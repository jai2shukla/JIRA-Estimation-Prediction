TESB-3801,"One connection factory is generated per cJMS component","Same applies for cActiveMQ components - but I assume we get rid of these anyway.    When multiple cJMS components are used in a route, the generated code defines a connection factory instance and component definition for each od these cJMSs. This is almost always wrong. In most cases all cJMS components in a route will use the same component (same alias, e.g. ""jms""). There are a few cases, for instance when a route should bridge between different messaging systems, more than one JMS component would need to be generated, like one for ""amq"" and a second one for ""wmq"". JMS connections should be treated like DB connections in service builder. JMS component aliases should be definable in one place and then selectable in each cJMS instance.",3
TESB-3802,"Transaction support in Route Builder for JMS components","Camel allows to switch on transaction support in a route with the _transacted()_ clause in the fluent language. This should be supported in the Route Builder. Currently it is not even possible to add this via the existing extension points like cJavaDSLProcessor, etc. Code generation for cJMS would also have to be updated/tailored.    Switching on transaction support also requires declaration of a transaction manager (from the Spring framework). It would be cool if the Route BUilder could generate all the necessary code in the route when transaction support is demanded.    *Note*: In the first iteration we will only target transactional use-cases for JMS components.",3
TESB-3803,"Define error handlers in routes in Route Builder","When not otherwise defined the behavior of the default error handler is to throw away a message in case of an error - Camel allows the configuration of an error handler, for the whole context or for each route.

TESB-3824,"Make sure RouteBuilder class is exposed when route is exported as OSGi bundle","The wrapper code is a critical piece of code which links us from the Studio environment, to the vanilla eclipse environment, to the runtime environment and it _badly_ needs refactoring.  The runtime environment is unnecessarily limited to just OSGI through the OSGI bundle dependency.  This and other dependencies should be separated from the core routebuilder code.    The route builder is so embedded inside (IMO) unnecessarily nested classes that the generated route cannot be accessed cleanly or used for anything other than launching in an overly restricted way (whether as OSGI or Talend job makes little difference).      Fortunately, I _think_ it can be effectively accessed for integration testing.  If not, the CI process is disrupted not just by tooling but by the fundamental design of the generated code.    I think we can currently still extract just the route from external code that calls Route(false) so that the camelContext is not started.  Right now the routeBuilder created by initRoute is already attached to the CamelContext.  In a unit test environment with CamelTest I think we can set the test context to the generated camelContext, and use the Route function to supply the configure method.  I will verify this.    But this should not have to be verified.  A peace of code this critical should be crystal clear.  Even with the code generator's impact, the code should be much better.  Much of the code can be moved into a non-generated framework class which is simply switched using a strategy pattern by the Studio via generated code.    PS: why is the method Route capitalized?  ",3

In my view this should also regard to activemq.    There can be more than one container installation within an environment (even a single host). And there also should only be one infrastructure service (if it is not clustered... which is a completely different story). The user should not be forced to shutdown unwanted infrastructure services within the container after start-up.

TESB-4116,"Multiple Redundant Connection Factories and Components Registered in Camel Context","Code generated by ESB studio seem to generate multiple redundant component registrations and also redundant connections factories.  For example, suppose multiple activemq endpoints are referenced in route.  They all refer to the same activemq connection, but they refer to different destination topics and routes.    In 5.0M4 this was the code that was generated.  I have to confirm that this is still the case in RC3.    Note that each component is registered with the camelContext, i.e. cActiveMQ1 is a Camel component that is used exactly once.  Likewise, a separate connection factory is created each time.    				camelContext.addComponent(""cActiveMQ1"",  						org.apache.activemq.camel.component.ActiveMQComponent  								.jmsComponent(amqConnectionFactory));  				amqConnectionFactory = new org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory(  						""tcp://localhost:61616"");  				camelContext.addComponent(""cActiveMQ7"",  						org.apache.activemq.camel.component.ActiveMQComponent  								.jmsComponent(amqConnectionFactory));  				amqConnectionFactory = new org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory(  						""tcp://localhost:61616"");  				camelContext.addComponent(""cActiveMQ2"",  						org.apache.activemq.camel.component.ActiveMQComponent  								.jmsComponent(amqConnectionFactory));  				amqConnectionFactory = new org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory(  						""tcp://localhost:61616"");  				camelContext.addComponent(""cActiveMQ4"",  						org.apache.activemq.camel.component.ActiveMQComponent  								.jmsComponent(amqConnectionFactory));  				amqConnectionFactory = new org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory(  						""tcp://localhost:61616"");  				camelContext.addComponent(""cActiveMQ6"",  						org.apache.activemq.camel.component.ActiveMQComponent  								.jmsComponent(amqConnectionFactory));  				amqConnectionFactory = new org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory(  						""tcp://localhost:61616"");  				camelContext.addComponent(""cActiveMQ9"",  						org.apache.activemq.camel.component.ActiveMQComponent  								.jmsComponent(amqConnectionFactory));    One approach is to manage context scope resources such as components via tabs within the cConfig component.  Things like the activemq connection and the formal camel activemq component  (i.e. endpoint factory) should be named properties that can then be referenced by actual activemq endpoint instances in much the same way sqlEndpoints reference a shared db connection. But these _should_not_ be global variables accessed via the Studio context.  They should be attached to the camel context.  ",1

I have  set the Camel Component Dependencies on the Advanced Setting tab to include saxon, which I assume is camel-saxon jar per the dependencies for the component.  But I still get the stack trace shown attached.    The problem is repeatable, but the error is intermittent.  I can get the route to run by adding arbitrary other camel-xxx dependencies in the advanced tab and then running the route.  It will work, once.  But then if I stop the route and try to run again it will fail.  I suspect it is a problem with how the Studio runtime is (re)loading the dependencies.  I don't think this happened in M04, when I first created the demo route.  It may have happened in RC1, because I remember encountering an intermittent ""surprise"" failure at a rather innopportune time, but I am not sure.     I have attached the following files:  exercise3-0.1.jar  log4j-properties.jar    The zip of the project export.  demo.zip    The zip of data files used by the project.  tdemo.zip    unzip the tdemo.zip file to the c:\ directory.  It contains the tdemo directory with a bunch of directories underneath.  The example uses \tdemo\04.    Start by testing the web service.    Set the cConfig element of the  ComponentSamples->CXF Server route to include the exercise3-0.1.jar file.  Start the ComponentSamples->CXF Server route.    Do the same for the cConfig element of the ComponentSamples->CXF Client route.  Start the client route.  It should send the same messages every 1/2 second.    Start the TransportMediation route.  The cConfig dependencies are not handled by export/import so reset the config of the fields to include exercise3-0.1.jar.  Check that the Advanced Settings dependencies for the Transform processor in the TransportMediation route is set to include saxon.  Run the route in Studio.  It should startup and wait for some files to process.    In order to run the sample import drop the \tdemo\04\data\orders.xml file into the \tdemo\04\in directory using explorer.    It may or may not work the first time.  If it works, stop the route route and try and rerun it to get the error.    If it fails, try adding some other arbitrary libraries to the Transform element (e.g. atom, or amqp).  Then retry.  It works - once.  And then it stops working again.            ",2

Without this feature the ESB SE Studio would still have value, but it would effectively remove the SL from being used with the GUI designer.

To serve requests cxf provider is started under the same container (using spring) as dataservice.  4) Client is usual cxf client being running by jmeter (which collects all statistics and controls execution flow)  5) wsdl contains service with one method with two parameters -- String clientId, int delay (should be specified in seconds).  6) Both cxf provider and dataservice use Thread.currenThread().sleep(delay * 1000) to emulate work of ""real provider"".

System.setProperty(""java.protocol.handler.pkgs"", ""com.sun.net.ssl.internal.www.protocol"");  System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStore"", ""./etc/keystore.jks"");  System.setProperty(""javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword"", ""password"");  {code}    Hence it tries to reset the system wide ssl configuration in order to configure the keystore for the current consumer job execution.    In my view there are two major problems with this approach:    {panel}  h4. 1. I don't think it is appropriate to ""silently"" reconfigure the system wide keystore configuration just in order to run a consumer job.    A running TESB container can have many purposes, not only running several consumer jobs. There might be other bundles running which need the system wide SSL configuration as it is - or as the user has configured it himself. Using this approach a consumer job would *silently* change the SSL configuration for the whole VM and does not even restore the previous configuration (which also would not be a proper solution in my view). This might break other functionality running in this container.    Also you could think of problems when running consumer jobs with different configuration in parallel.      h4. 2. This approach setting the ssl system properties is not working when running the consumer job within the TESB container anyway. :)     After some (long) analysis - finally using jconsole and taking a look into the list of current system properties in the running consumer VM after having executed the consumer job - I've found out that the system properties are definitelly not set! Either the code is not been executed - or there is any security mechanism in Karaf disabling the possibility to set these properties programatically. I don't know.    As the path to the keystore file has not been set, the system uses the default Java truststore. Based on this the handshake with the correctly configured provider using Karaf HTTPS configuration fails, as the required certificate cannot be found in the default truststore on consumer side. A corresponding handshake exception is also visible on provider side:    {code}  javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: certificate_unknown      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Alerts.getSSLException(Alerts.java:174)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Alerts.getSSLException(Alerts.java:136)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.recvAlert(SSLSocketImpl.java:1806)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.readRecord(SSLSocketImpl.java:986)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.performInitialHandshake(SSLSocketImpl.java:1170)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.startHandshake(SSLSocketImpl.java:1197)[:1.6]      at com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.SSLSocketImpl.startHandshake(SSLSocketImpl.java:1181)[:1.6]      at org.eclipse.jetty.server.ssl.SslSocketConnector$SslConnectorEndPoint.run(SslSocketConnector.java:659)[59:org.eclipse.jetty.server:7.4.5.v20110725]      at org.eclipse.jetty.util.thread.QueuedThreadPool$3.run(QueuedThreadPool.java:529)[53:org.eclipse.jetty.util:7.4.5.v20110725]      at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:680)[:1.6.0_29]  {code}    As a _*workaround*_ I've set the same properties (_javax.net.ssl.trustStore_ and _javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword_) with the same configuration (path and password) as ""-D"" parameter in the TESB start script ""trun"" and have executed the same consumer job feature once again. The result was a successful request-response message exchange in this case.   {panel}    I think the proper and better approach for HTTPS configuration on consumer side with CXF is to _*create / generate a corresponding XML html-conduit configuration using spring/blueprint*_. As additional advantage this approach would also enable a setting which is not available with the normal Java SSL configuration: _*disabling the host verification*_ - which is a _*very helpful*_ feature for many usages and is been implemented by all containers (including Karaf) - except pure old Java itself. :) Such a solution would enable us to add a corresponding check box in the component. With the current approach (setting the SSL properties) such a feature is not available.    Please note that using *tSetKeystore* component instead of directly configuring SSL within the tESBConsumer component does not fix the problem as the approach of the generated code is the same.    => Find attached the exported consumer job as example.      <Additions Zsolt>  The settings for trust store and password are only meant for the stand alone case. It's anyway not the job of the job /route / service designer to specify the location of the trust store in the container. This is the responsibility of an admin. We should rather provide a way to specify these properties container wide and use them for all data service clients. These properties are:  - WSDL port name for which the configuration is valid  - location of the trust store and corresponding password  - location of the key store and corresponding password  - alias for the certificate  - host verification on / off  Of course it should be possible to specify configuration for several ports.    As usual part of this item is to add documentation for this feature.    </Additions Zsolt>",3

TESB-4539,"Modify cBean To Register Beans with Container","cBean only creates anonymous beans based on a Class rather than Objects.  These anonymous beans cannot be configured using constructors.  As a result the user is forced to configure them with code rather than GUI.    In addition, there is no singleton object, so references to the Bean  different routes end up created different Bean instances which are unaware of each other.  Even in the cConfig section because there is no means of getting a handle to them.    As a result the user is left writing Java code without a real object based component framework.  It is important that our code generator generates code which uses a solid component framework rather than building from the ground up.  While the user or us could reinvent the wheel, it is important that our components build and extend existing frameworks correctly.    The Camel Context Registry interface is can _lookup_ beans, but the bean id is required.  The Camel Registry does not serve to register beans.  So the best solution would be to inject an abstraction of the container that allows registration of beans.      These beans should be fairly general so their properties can be configured by the user without writing code.  An important ability is for Beans to refer to other Beans via their properties.    Like the cConfig bean they are not directly connected to Routes.  Instead, they are connected to Routes via the cBean with a ref property.  Like cConfig, and unlike the EIP oriented elements, the beans are referenced by the flow rather than participating directly in the wiring.  So it may make sense to have another Resource or Bean tab perspective (like the code or design tabs) that shows the wiring of these static resources.  This keeps separation of concerns between resource structure and message flow.",3

TESB-4998,"Runtime Update PoC","In a first feature we investigated what the specific problems we encounter with update management in an OSGi environment and what the possible solutions are. This feature goes one step further where its goal is to make a PoC to provide a rudimentary update framework. It is assumed that the  new version does not override the old one but is installed beside the old one. So the goal of the updte framework is to take over user defined features / bundles / configurations and TESB Runtime configuration that was changed by the user, e.g port. Also it can be assumed that all user defined artifacts are still accessible and can be retrieved to be installed in the new container. Normallythey will reside in Archiva or some other Maven repository.    Basic idea is to have one component in the old container which retrieves a list of all feature repositories together with the url from which they were installed, and the list of all installed features. From these two lists the repositories and features that natively come with TESB runtime are removed. Another component in the new container is then responsible to take the list and make all feature repositories known in the container and to install all the features specified in the list.    For the configuration we either copy the whole ./etc directory from the old container to the new one and set the properties new for the current version via config admin or retrieve via config admin a list of all properties of the old container and apply it to the new conatiner. Make sure there is no conflict with configuration set when the usser defined features are installed.    Important is to validate the approach is feasable not to automate everything and to have a polished tooling. ",5

In earlier versions, none of it was generated for GET.  Obviously having the 'body' does not make sense for GET.  Here is the generated code signature for GET:    		@javax.ws.rs.GET()  		@javax.ws.rs.Path(""/"")  		public javax.ws.rs.core.Response echo(    				@javax.ws.rs.DefaultValue("""") @javax.ws.rs.PathParam(""string"") String string    		)    This String 'string' parameter is not required.     for other methods it does not make sense to have both  'body' and 'string', here is the generated signature for POST:  @javax.ws.rs.POST()  		@javax.ws.rs.Path(""/"")  		public javax.ws.rs.core.Response test(    				@javax.ws.rs.DefaultValue("""") @javax.ws.rs.PathParam(""string"") String string    				, org.dom4j.Document body    		)    here this 'string' is not required either.    This is all the side-effect of having 'String' parameter added by default to the schema of an individual mapping.  I wonder if the idea was to capture either the input to either Document or String: this can not work with the above signature.  The request body, if any, can only be converted to Document.    Summary:  1. The schema for GET (&DELETE) mappings must be empty by default: no 'body' can be supported for GET (&DELETE) requests while 'string' parameter is not required and can only confuse the users  2. The schema for POST/PUT  - 'string' parameter needs to be dropped   - if possible: make 'body' read only                    ",1

Situation became much more interesting, when we are using sam enabled consumer with usual provider. In that case only one message doesn't(!!) contain message_id (some of RESP_IN message, it impossible to find out from where exactly this message by info from events). Other events -- contains the same message id. And the same message has shortened (as in previous example) message content. Other have the same message content which include a lot of different information in header of envelop (flow id, etc..).

As part of this feature a CXF registry client shall be implemented to lookup Policy Attachment documents in a remote registry. The component shall lookup based on the fully qualified service name for a CXF service or client the corresponding policy attchment document  in the remote registry and make it available to CXF. The endpoint of the registry must be configurable. There should be no extra configuration be necessary in the service or client component Ideally the registry client should work with all services and clients. Assume the service interface of the registry is pure HTTP based, following the REST architectural style. For the registry a simple HTTP server, e.g. Apache or Tomcat, may be used where the required policy attachment documents are stored in the file system and statically retrieved by the server.    Because this is a PoC no detailed error handling is necessary, also no official documentation is required. Still provide a short readme how to configure the server so it is able to serve the expected documents and how to enable the registry client within the runtime.    ",5

TESB-6710,"When adding the sam feature to the cxf bus instead of a single endpoint the monitoring service call is logged and goes into recursion","Normally the evenFeature is added into the endpoint or client. In some cases it makes sense to simply add the feature to the cxf bus. For example when using the camel from(""cxf:address"") there is no endpoint bean to add the sam feature to.     So you add the evenFeature into  <cxf:bus><cxf:features>  <ref bean=""eventFeature""/>  </cxf:features></cxf:bus>    In this case every service call triggers the monitoring service call. Then the monitoring service call triggers the monitoring which triggers the monitoring ....    So a simple solution would be to filter out all service calls that originate from the monitoring service.

TESB-6923,"Authentication / Authorization for Service Locator","Currently access to the Service Locator server (aka ZooKeeper) is not not restricted at all. As an administrator I want to be able to restrict access to the content of the SL so that malicious modifications from unknown parties are prevented.    ZooKeeper allows to restrict acces to node and content by setting ACL's for each node. ZooKeeper provides different authentication schemes , e.g. IP address or Digest. Digest is basically user name password authentication where password is digested. Drawback of the digest authentication scheme is the lack of a backend which really checks user logins. Currently every login is accepted.  Fortunately ZooKeeper provides  a way to implement and register own AuthenticationProviders. This feature is about a custom authentication scheme ""sl"" which is backed by a custom AuthenticationProvider based on JAAS login module. See http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.6/zookeeperProgrammers.html#sc_ZooKeeperPluggableAuthentication for more information about the AuthenticationProvider interface. The handleAuthentication is the method  to validate authentication information by forwarding the id and credentials to the login module. To make the handling more flexible permissions ACL's attached to the nodes in ZooKeeper will not include users as identity, but roles.  The matches method should be used to ensure whether the authenticated user has the role which is specified in the ACL. Therefore we need to provide roles in the JAAS backends for the users and evaluate whether the user has the required role.  The following roles will be available    - SL_READ  - SL_MAINTAIN  - SL_ALL    The authentication feature is only relevant for ZooKeeper running within OSGi, not for the stand-alone version. A fragment bundle should be used to add the AuthenticationProvider to ZooKeeper.     Whether authentication is enforced by the Service Locator server should be configurable. If authentication is not enabled 5.1 clients must run successfully against the 5.2 server.    How to add user and roles for the Service locator and the additional parameters should be documented.

TESB-6925,"SR: Provide an AtomPub collection resource for policies in the registry","As developer of clients for registries I like to have a standard based REST conform interface, so that the syntax and semantics is easy to grasp    The Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub or APP) is an application-level protocol for publishing and editing Web resources. In this sense it nicely fits to the requirements of a client interface for the registry that folloes the REST style.   As first step this feature is about the corresponding APP based interface for policy documents. The registry needs to provide a collection resource following the APP specification for policies. It must be possible to add, update and delete policies to the collection as specified in the spec. All mandatory meta data must be provided, especially the corresponding link elements. The policies itselve must be included within a content element as XML. We need to invent our own proprietary MIME media type for policy documents (if none yet exists) to be used as type attribute for the content element.    ID's used within meta data or URL's must be opaque (no policy name). Also HTTP staus codes should be used as specified in the specs.    Update documentation reflecting the new APP based interface. Especially provide sample requests and responses for the new interface. Document possible error situations and corresponding HTTP status codes.",3

If we need  to ensure access restriction are set on this node creation by a client is not secure. Therefore we need to create a component delivered with the Service Locator server (aka ZooKeeper), which at startup checks wheter the root node is available and if not create it. Also if security is enabled the node must be secured.  ",2

These are participating in the Data Service design, development and deployment process as following:    * Job Designer has a business problem to solve., Job designer is able to create a job and test it against a (local) test database. Job Designer do not know location and system details of the target environment (DB host name, username, password) as well as she is not aware about technical constraints of databases (number of concurrent connections). Job Designer uses check a checkbox on database connection component to enable shared connection pooling in Runtime and give a pre-defined connection pool alias. After that Data Service is published on Talend Artifact Repository.    * System Administrator may not be aware about specific business problem, she is however know all the environment details (database host, port, username and password) as well as configuration details (number of concurrent connections). System Administrator configure a system pool under pre-defined alias and specify all required information (host, port, username/password, maximum number of concurrent connections and other pool properties and DB-specific configuration options). After that System Administrator uses TAC to deploy Data Service form Talend Artifact Repository.    h3. Technical structure    h4.

The conduits-common configuration we currently provide by default with the runtime is valid for all clients, which communicate with an HTTPS based endpoint. This works fine for clients accessing our samples as the configuration points to a keystore with certificates suitable for the samples. Clients accessing services hosted on public servers, e.g. salesforce services, fail to do so, because the keystore we provide does not contain the required root certificates from the public certification authorities. On the other side these certificates are included in the default keystore that comes with the JRE. Therefore we should restrict the pattern for the conduits-common configuration to https on localhost, e.g. url = https\://localhost.*    This would also restrict disabling the CN checks to the localhost.

If 'prod' context does not exists in job - use default, but warning should be in log.  - Use default job context: job starts with default context. Means not with name==Default, but context which configred to be default.",2
TESB-8344,"cTalendJob: Only allow Jobs with tRouteInput component to be selected within the cTalendJob","When we configure cTalendJob and select Job from repository, in the dialog 'Find a Job' we:  - show all jobs,  - all jobs which has no tRouteInput component are disabled and we can't select them,  - in the bottom of the dialog should be text: ""Here only jobs with tRoutInput component can be selected."" (or simular)    (?) how it will work with 300-400 jobs? if to get this list it timeconsuming:  - show all jobs,  - user select job, if job does not have tRouteInput - job shouldn't set to cTalendJob, show message 'Only jobs with tRoutInput component can be selected.'

TESB-8356,"Data Service REST: SL support for REST components remaining issues","Here we need to fix/finalyze leftovers to support SL in the REST components:  1. add ESB configuration files into standalone export package  2. -custom properties: recheck (on demo scenario was fault)-  3. add ESB configuration files on classpath in Studio (reimplement)  4. Service namespace/name: finalyze approach.  Proposal:   * We introduce additional parameter in the ESB - Service-REST settings: Default Service Namespace == 'http://www.talend.org/rest/'  This will allow user to customize Studio for default Service namespace values for REST components.    * REST service:   Service namespace should be set by default: <Default Service Namespace>. User is allowed to change it.  Service name should be the name of the job. User is NOT allowed to change it.  In result service qname will looks: {service_namespace}name    * REST client:    Service namespace should be set by default: <Default Service Namespace>. User is allowed to change it.    Service name is empty by default. User is allowed to change it.    In result service qname will looks: {service_namespace}name     ",2
TESB-8357,"tRESTRequest - Change the generated code of SL Custom properties to add quotation marks","for now, the default name and value of custom properties is : *name , value*  but in fact, in order to generate right code, user has to input ""name"" and ""value""  So a possible way to fix it is: *Add quotation mars* automatically when generate code.  and after this, we will resolve another problem: at present, the inputs will be recorded as properties in generated spring file. so if user inputs ""name"" and ""value"", then on client side, he have to input ""\""name\"""" and ""\""value\"""".    So another aspect: *we should unify the behaviour of tRESTClient and tRESTRequest, add quotation marks automatically both for them, or else not add for both of them*",1

We like to get Syncope running within the Talend Runtime (EE Only)     We like to be able to install/run the server and Web-Ui part within the container as feature.  It is ok to keep the embedded h2 database as default for now.    We do not plan any changes to Syncope for now if not needed to make it working within the Talend Runtime.      All features related to syncope should start with tidm-server-xxxx   / tidm-console-xxx",3

Expection is that this should be enough to trigger the authorization feature (PEP interceptor etc.)",1
TESB-8402,"Get tRESTResponse schema accepting more types","User has asked how to use tRESTResponse to return PDF from a database.  At the moment tRESTResponse supports only Document and String thus returning the binary data (as byte[] or Object) will not work.    Proposal: update tRESTResponse schema to allow Object and possibly byte[].    Note, the generated methods will have @Produces(""application/xml"", ""application/json"" and ""text/plain"") output media types supported. However, according to the JAX-RS spec, if JAX-RS Response has a custom media type set then this type will be preferred to the one declared in @Consumes.    Thus, if the user will use Object or byte[] response type, and set response Content-Type manually in tRESTResponse/AdvancedProperties/HTTP Headers, example to ""application/pdf"", then it will work very well at CXF level.    So, simply allowing tRESTResponse accepting Object and/or byte[] will be all what is needed (at this stage) to let users return binary data too        ",2

See http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/proj/seda/, http://camel.apache.org/seda.html  Note that queues are only visible within a single CamelContext.  - VM component (cVM): asynchronous SEDA behavior, See http://camel.apache.org/vm.html  This component differs from the SEDA component in that VM supports communication across CamelContext instances.     We also need an improved component properties for specialized components, so that users wouldn't need to enter lengthy URLs.  Ask about icons. Initially use from cMessageEndpoint.    For components which acts as producer:  allow the consumer to be selected from a dropdown listbox of existing endpoints (consumers from current Job).

TESB-9347,"Update tRESTRequest Component Configuration to let users explicitly choose the supported data formats","At the moment the REST jobs built with the help of ESB/REST components can only support XML and JSON payloads. Optionally, the plain form (""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"") on the input only can be supported.    The support for different format types can be required. Typical example: upload a binary file or user registration.  OAuth flows will need the support for out ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"" responses. Etc.    The proposal is to update the tRESTRequest Component Configuration to let users explicitly choose the supported data formats.    Specifically the following approach is proposed. Two new columns, ""Consumes"" and ""Produces"", to be added to the component configuration editor. The user can click on the drop-down list and select one of the following from the easy to understand format descriptions :        XML      JSON      XML or JSON      Form      Multipart Form    with more formats added as required.    The code generator will simply convert the selected values to the correct Consumes and or Produces JAX-RS annotations, for example,  XML -> @Produces(""application/xml"")  XML or JSON -> @Produces({""application/xml"", ""application/json"")  Multipart Form -> @Consumes(""multipart/form-data"")    etc.    Note that all the formats from the above list except Multipart Form are already supported. A dedicated JORA for supporting multipart/form-data is to be opened next.

So we either must save the WSDL in the Process and not require it to be 'live' accessible (same we did for tESBConsumer) or we need to make sure that we first call the SL and then use the endpoint for the ?WSDL (if this is possible even in this order - most likely not as CXF needs the Service Description most likely first) - So option one to get and save the WSDL with eh process design seems the right way to achive a more stable / easy deplyoment. Currently each service call in the process design needs to be updated manually !",2

This is not possible for concrete classes. Probably it can work using asm but this is a sure cause of headaches.    So I propose to additionally publish these features with the interface org.apache.cxf.feature.Feature.

Camel supports an [OGNL dot notation|http://camel.apache.org/ognl.html] to invoke operations. Therefore using a dot within a header field would easily cause confusing (even thou it is working).  Camel uses a CamelLetterConvention for header field names. This would also be recommended for talend log events.

TESB-11187,"EventLogging: Improve database structure of Event Logging SQL database","Just like the SAM database structure the Event logging structure is far away from being optimal.  Considering the possibly _large_ number of records the may end up inside the SQL tables esp. the primary keys / index definitions should be reconsidered.  Note that this discussion is based on the default DDL (create.sql / create_ind.sql - appears to be for Derby).    * Using a UUID as primary key appears to be a not extremely good idea.  ** While it can be argued that by definition the UUID is pretty unique, it still doe _not_ not come with a guarantee to be (http://tinyurl.com/6z94fcv ). Apart from the fact that the low probability does not say anything about _when_ the algorithm will produce a duplicate - it just how often duplicates statistically arise number of calls. ( Black swans do exist - even though statistically they appear to be non-existent ;-) )  ** When considering that the DDL creates the ID field (regardless of whether is should be a primary key or not!) as a {code}ID VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL{code}, one should note that for today's 128 bit UUIDs a field length of 36 characters would be sufficient. Note that databases - on the physical page level - are rather unhappy with variable length keys. With fixed length keys there are much more efficient when maintaining index / table spaces - esp. finding out, on which physical page a record / index entry can be found.  ** From perspective of the application, it can be fine to have this UUID as a column (if sized correctly), but it should not be a primary key, because - even with the length shortened as explained above, it will unnecessarily blow up the index space of the database. Instead, a serial (incrementable) number (like in SAM DB) would be a much better choice, because  *** unique key generation can be made safely inside a database transaction and will be extremely cheap - esp. when considering that with batch inserts the software could obtain the keys for all records in the insert batch with one minimal operation (e.g. when having to insert 20 records we just need to increment the sequence field by 20 once, close the transaction, assign the keys and insert our batch while in parallel another request would be save to allocate new IDs for the batch of records it tries to insert - so even multiple Event Logging server processes could work efficiently in parallel using the same database).  *** it takes much less space (and we are talking about a database where we have to expect large amounts of records) in the primary table *EVENTLOG* and the secondary table *EVENTLOG_CUSTOMINFO*  *** while we do not have a strict sequence order in all case, the records are still _pretty_ much in sequence order - which could simplify garbage collection (recurring clean up of tables which is put on the customer's shoulders for now ...) and increase the chance of database internal cache hits when sequentially processing records.    * Creating primary keys for secondary table *EVENTLOG_CUSTOMINFO* is unnecessarily inefficient (see also TESB-9724 !).   ** We should not require a sequence field here! Instead we should use a fixed length composite key of EVENT_ID (assuming that it's ""just"" a number) and a short _local_ sequence number we can generate on the fly when inserting the custom properties (as we know how many custom properties come with the EVENT record we just assign numbers from 1..<numberOfCustomProperties> ).   ** Consequently the sub ID field does not have to be long (we save space on the primary index). Using this composite key will also increase the probability that the database stores the dependent records for the custom info physically in the same or a nearby located database segment - so the chances of a database cache hit is increased.  ** With that kind of primary key, there's no need to add and maintain the additional index needed for joining *EVENTLOG* and *EVENTLOG_CUSTOMINFO* records - which again saves database space and provides more performance.    So, please, please, remove this technical dept from Event Logging. For SAM it's already much harder than here, because SAM is already out with the customers and any schema change would require a data migration for customer data. With event logging we could avoid this from the start.",2

For example, in case we import Bar process file to other Studio.     It was fixed in 5.4 (trunk) for file and url case.

TESB-12363,"Backport-5.3.2 - Hyperic - issue with dynamic bus.id to map Services after Talend Runtime restart","The bus.id gets a different ID each time a service is (re-)started.

TESB-12367,"Backport-5.3.2 - zkServer.sh script does not work correctly on AIX, Solaris and Windows platforms","The bin/zkServer.sh script creates a 'zookeeper_server.pid' file to store its process id - that does not work correctly on Solaris and Windows platforms, so that the process does not get terminated later when running ""zkServer.sh stop"".    Specifically, on Solaris platform:    /bin/echo -n $! > ""$ZOOPIDFILE""     /bin/echo on this platform does not have the ""-n"" parameter and thus, instead of the expected ""<pid>"", the ""-n <pid>"" output gets produced. Possibly, the embedded shell ""echo"" command should be used here instead.    Please note, 'man 1 echo' on Solaris 10 says:   ""In addition, ksh's echo, does not have an -n option. sh's  echo       and  /usr/bin/echo  only  have  an  -n  option  if the SYSV3       environment  variable  is  set  (see  ENVIRONMENT  VARIABLES       below).  If  it  is, none of the backslashed characters men-       tioned above are available. csh's echo and /usr/ucb/echo, on       the other hand, have an -n option, but do not understand the       back-slashed escape characters.""    One more possible solution is probably to check if ""-n"" is really necessary here...    On Windows platform:    TASKLIST /FI ^""WINDOWTITLE eq zookeeper^"" /NH    the specified construct does not find the process correctly, thus causing just ""0"" to be output into the pid file.      PS. As a separate issue here - the script should not end successfully and remove the .pid file if there were problems in the previous commands.  ",2

Advanced Settings.  - rename to 'Consumer Policies'  - in case 'Manage consumer policies' checkbox is checked - show table with the list of the aliases. Before we show list of the aliases in the assign dialog. Only for one alias it's possible to set default. It should be possible to add/delete/edit aliases. It should be possible to change 'default' alias. These aliases will be used for assignment in the 'Available policies' tab - see next point.    3. Available policies.  - before 'Assign' button add checkbox with list of available aliases + <provider> record.     By this we change way for assignment behavior:  - we do not need 'Advanced assignment' dialog anymore.  - if <provider> is selected - just create provider policy attachment,  - if any alias selected - create consumer policy attachment with selected alias.
