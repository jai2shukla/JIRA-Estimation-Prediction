I thought maybe just my keyboard wasn't working, since I had never experienced something like that before.

So, not sure if there is another bug and this is just a side-afect, or if this is a bug that can be isolated.    I don't know how to replicate this. All I know is that it is happening at seemingly random times.    Update:    Some people have reported relief after unbinding the shortcut 'command + c' from 'copy' under Preferences/General/keys.

I asked in the #ubuntu irc why the package is removed from the current version and they told me that. They forwarded me to the Mozilla Website where they wrote that sience Firefox 4 the XULRunner is disables be default because of this security issues. (1.9.2 is only for Firefox 3.*)    I know it's very much to ask, but i think it's a good idea if Aptana could run without the XULrunner.

APSTUD-3723,"PHP: Open Method (ala PDT) functionality","PDT has an ""Open Method"" that allows the user to navigate to any method/class in any PHP file in a project/workspace.  This makes it a lot easier to locate a particular method or browse methods when looking the right method to use.  The list of methods is filterable (find as you type) and allows wildcards ({{*}}) as well to allow more flexible method listings.    Now that Aptana Studio 3 conflicts with PDT so that PDT's editor no longer works properly, it would be great if Aptana Studio added this feature to further round out the workflow that was lost from PDT.    For reference, the ""Open Method"" feature in PDT is launched via the following shortcut by default: {{CTRL+SHIFT+M}}",1

For example, if I set Before = 1 and After = 0, I get:  {code}  var a = function (b, c, d) { // BAD Don't want the space before function arguments here      alert (b + c + d); // BAD Don't want the space before invokation arguments here  }  var c = a ? 10 : 20;  var bb = {      ""a"": 1,      ""b"": 2,      ""c"": 3  };  for (var i = 0, j = 0; i < 8 && j >= 0; i++, --j) { // GOOD This space is good      alert (""(a "" + a + "",j "" + j + "")""); // BAD Don't want the space before invokation arguments here  }  if (xyz[1] >= 5) { // GOOD This space is good  {code}    If I set Before = 0 and After = 0, I get    {code}  var a = function(b, c, d) { // GOOD      alert(b + c + d); // GOOD  }  var c = a ? 10 : 20;  var bb = {      ""a"": 1,      ""b"": 2,      ""c"": 3  };    for(var i = 0, j = 0; i < 8 && j >= 0; i++, --j) { // BAD I want a space here      alert(""(a "" + a + "",j "" + j + "")""); // GOOD  }  if(xyz[1] >= 5) { // BAD I want a space here  {code}    If there were separate Parentheses rules for function arguments, function invocation, and for/if/etc clauses, it'd be much nicer.",20

Steps to Replicate :    1) Select a folder from Local FileSystem node.  2) Select Context Menu > Rename.  3) CTRL+C folder name string.  4) CTRL+V in place.    Actual Results : Please see capture at http://www.screencast.com/t/xxorH2jOc.

Expected Results : this action should not have any effect on the file system.  ",5
APSTUD-3967,"PHP Variable, Function and Class documentation requires a save before it appears in content assist with Build Participation.","When working on a php file in the editor any documentation that is done for variables, functions, and classes does not appear in the item's content entry. This is the case for both single line and multi line comments. I'm expecting this is an actual issue since the Javascript editor picks up new documentation and changes to existing documentation without requiring a save.    Steps to Reproduce:  1) In the php editor define a class in a php file.  {noformat}  class Bird{      function fly(){          echo ""I'm flying!"";      }  }  {noformat}  2) Check the content assist for the class, notice that no documentation is present.  3) Add a comment above the class. Use the multi-line documentation style.  {noformat}  /**   * A class for representing birds.   */  class Bird{      function fly(){          echo ""I'm flying!"";      }  }  {noformat}  4) Check the content assist for the class. Note whether or not there is documentation present.  5) Save the file  6) Check the content assist for the class. Note whether or not there is documentation present.    Actual Results: No documentation is present on step 4 but documentation is present on step 6.  Expected Results: Documentation is present on step 4.    The same also occurs with variables and functions.    On a possibly related note: Creating a TODO comment doesn't cause the todo icon (clipboard) to appear next to the line numbers until after saving when working with php. Like the above issue, the javascript editor picks up the todo immediately without requiring a save. If these two issues are separate entities I can open a new issue for the TODO tags in php.",20

APSTUD-4129,"Behavior of JSLint validator options does not match those from JSLint.com","JSLint supports the addition of comments to the top of a JavaScript as a means of setting JSLint options.

(Full documentation of JSLint options here: http://www.jslint.com/lint.html#options)    However, in Aptana Studio the opposite is occurring.  So setting 'white' to true causes whitespace to become important, rather than be ignored as expected.    I've found that others have mentioned this behavior on Stack Overflow:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6893045/jslint-options-doesnt-seem-to-work-on-aptana-3  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8597253/problems-with-jslint-options-in-aptana-studio-3    I've also found the same reversed logic with: 'plusplus', 'undef', 'regexp', 'nomen', and 'newcap' (and there are likely others).

APSTUD-4281,"As a developer I want to be able to turn on and off specific validators for build vs reconcile","We need some way to turn off validators individually, and in particular between build vs reconcile. This stems from the poor performance of the JS validators during large builds. They should default to be on for reconcile (only the ones currently on by default) and off for build (likely the same for the CSS/HTML validators). We'll need a preference page similar to the validator pref page we had before (maybe just re-use/fix it to work).    One suggestion is to reuse the existing pref page and instead have a table at the top with two checkbox columns, one for build and one for reconcile. A less-optimal solution is to have two separate lists, one for each type of interaction.    Perhaps we should say ""On Typing"" as opposed to ""Reconcile""? Perhaps that is more user-friendly?    Tasks:  * Change the pref page  * Add some methods/fields to the participants to mark them as validators  * Use a more sane preference key scheme to store the enable/disable  * Create a migration function to migrate the old pref keys to the new scheme  * Some build participants need to be unchangeable or hidden from the end user (like indexing)  ",40

APSTUD-4285,"Research heap exception and excessive I/O during indexing JS","Some profiling has been done already which has identified that:    # A large number of strings/char[] are being held onto during indexing. I think it's safe to assume that's related to JS inferencing, but that will need to be confirmed. Once that is verified, we need to look into why that is happening.  # There are a huge number of disk writes occurring during JS inferencing. I confirmed this by re-indexing the referenced project with JS indexing on and off. We know the issue is coming from JS inferencing due to the fact that Index is not designed to support reads when doing lots of writes. We will need to determine how we can avoid or how we can minimize reading from the Index during inferencing.",20
APSTUD-4289,"JS indexing stores duplicate user agents on properties and functions","While gathering stats on how JS indexing info is stored, I noticed that some properties and functions were quite large in the index (>4K). Looking at a few of these, I see that there is a large amount of user agent added to some of the entries and many of these are duplicates. So, we will need to switch over to using a set to contain user agent elements and user agent elements themselves will need equals and hashCode implementations",8
APSTUD-4292,"Consider caching UserAgentElements used in JS indexing","During profiling of indexing for a large JS project, I noticed that we had a large number of allocations of UserAgentElements. There is a finite list of these, so we should be able to cache these instances, thus avoiding a large number of allocations and garbage collection steps.",8
APSTUD-4298,"Consider using a special token to indicate that a given JS type or member should have all user agents associated with it","Given the number of user agents we attach with inferred types and members, we should use a custom tag to indicate that the item should have all user agents associated with it. Looking at a large method entry in the index, we could cut down one entry from 3359 to 2595, for example. This may not sound significant, but in the closure-library this could potentially shave off as much as 42MB from a 71MB index given the high number of property and function counts there. This, of course, would need to be verified and should be considered an upper maximum in file size reduction",8
APSTUD-4300,"Consider improving the performance of StringUtil.join","During profiling I noticed a large number of calls to StringUtil.join. At times, this method appeared as a hot spot as well. I believe the current implementation can be improved by pre-allocating a char[] of the destination size followed by copying of the strings and delimiters into this array. This is similar to what StringBuilder is doing; however, we avoid a number of method calls and we have the advantage of knowing the resulting size a priori. Note that StringBuilder does allow the initial capacity to be defined. FWIW, I had made similar changes in ParseNode for the child arrays (replaced ArrayList with our own inline implementation) and this affected performance dramatically.",8
APSTUD-4301,"Reduce number of refreshes in Git Index and reduce work done during refresh","Previously I thought we could entirely remove refreshes when files change inside a git connected project. Turns out that we couldn't but there are other things we can do:  - When we get resource change events, only update the changed files, don't do a full batch refresh.  - Don't call batch refreshes from some actions like deleting files/folder or moving files through our UI. The connected filewatcher on the repo should pick up a file event or two to the ""index"" file which will trigger a batch refresh.  - When we do refresh we call one process and then we spawn off 3 parallel jobs to each run another process to update our listings. We may be able to reduce the number of processes down to as low as one in most cases (or two in worst case).",8

APSTUD-4354,"PHP Namespaces - Allow non-local functions to be called statically","I've noticed that many of the newer PHP 5.3 based frameworks contain an autoloader of some sort that allows for developers to use classes in files that have no reference to said class. When trying to call a class where there is no namespace though, I am told there is no proposal. It would greatly help me as a developer to have the functions of a class proposed for me when I don't have a namespace defined.    I've attached a couple of images to help explain what I'm asking for. In the first image, where there are no proposals, because of how the way the framework is written, it would be great if the function list was there even though a namespace wasn't called.    Here are just two frameworks that allow for this:  https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/application/controllers/home.php  https://github.com/fuel/fuel/blob/1.1/master/fuel/app/classes/controller/welcome.php",13

APSTUD-4406,"Character Encoding options broken, falsely reporting UTF-8","A well known issue with deploying Titanium projects to android that has existed for a long, long time is problems with the Android emulator requiring files to be UTF-8.    So naturally if you ran across the issue when using TiStudio, you would right click the files, go to properties and check your 'Text file encoding' was set to UTF08. It automatically chooses the option titled 'Inherited from container (UTF-8)'.    So according to Aptana/TiStudio, the file is set to UTF-8. Yet the android emulator is still throwing a wobbly over a non UTF-8 file.    I then opened the exact file in Coda (by panic.com) to find that every single one of the Titanium Studio files was in face set to ""Western (Mac OS Roman)"" and not UTF-8. I edited the files to UTF-8 via Coda and hey presto, the android project works. The same action in Aptana/TiStudio does not work, it leaves the files in their old encoding.    The bug here is quite simply that the Aptana text file encoding options for files dont change the file encoding at all. This has been present since at very least when Appcelerator bought out Titanium Studio.

APSTUD-4443,"Manage the PHP indexing through a PHP build participant","We need to have the PHP indexing process triggered and controlled via the build-participant.  Also, we need to allow caching of the PHPParseState to improve performance (at the moment, caching is disabled to allow re-parsing and error flushing).   This will require some modification in the indexer itself, and changes in the way we deliver the PHP errors to the markers (hold the errors in the parse-state, modify/remove the BuildProblemReporter, etc.)",20
APSTUD-4444,"JS inference infers the type of logical expressions to be Boolean incorrectly","A logical expression in JavaScript using the operators || or && returns one of its operands, not a boolean evaluation of them as might be expected in other languages.  Aptana 3.1.0.201202291203 incorrectly infers the type of a variable assigned to such an expression as Boolean without considering the type of its operands.  An example is the very common JS idiom for giving an argument a default value or type in the case that it is omitted when the function is called:    {code:JavaScript}  function foo (optionalString) {      optionalString = optionalString || """"; // if it's been left out, make sure it's a string.      /* do other stuff... */  }  {code}    Inference could deduce the type of a logical expression to be the union of the types of its operands, but in my experience, the actual desired type is always the type of the right operand if it isn't Boolean.",8
APSTUD-4445,"Content assist, inference, and documentation languages lack expressions to explicitly relate types to identifiers","The languages defined for adding documentation that affects content assist (ScriptDoc, SDocML, JSCA JSON) have type expressions whose grammer is inadequate in cases where the type is not specifically known beforehand, but can reliably be deduced from parameters.  Consider the ES5 Object.create, which creates a new object with a prototype specified by its parameter:    {code:JavaScript}  foo = new KnowTypeWithDocumentedProperties;  bar = Object.create(foo);  {code}    In that case, bar will have the same properties as foo.  However, it is not possible to infer them from the (hypothetical future) documentation for the Object.create method because the documentation languages lack a way to express that the return type will be the same as one of the parameters.    Perhaps more common:    {code:JavaScript}  BaseClass.prototype.chainableMethod = function () {      /* do something... */      return this;  }    DerivedClass.prototype = new BaseClass;    exampleInstance = new DerivedClass;  exampleReturn = exampleInstance.chainableMethod();  {code}    It is currently impossible to express that chainableMethod returns the same type as the object that owns it.  At best, inference will be able to guess that exampleReturn is an instance of BaseClass.  If many types derive from BaseClass, this is a problem, since content assist will be unable to infer any of the subclass properties after the call to chainableMethod, and a chainable method's purpose is to conveniently call additional methods on the return value.    The following would be really maddening to document:    {code:JavaScript}  dojo.declare(""my.ClassName"", Superclass, {      constructor: function () { /* ... */ },      someProperty: /* ... */  });    instance = new my.ClassName;  {code}    All of the properties that should be inferred for instance are in the parameters to dojo.declare; some day, when the ScriptDoc tags for assigning class membership work for inference, it will be possible for dojo users to document the class, but it will still be difficult/impossible for the authors of dojo.declare to provide type information.    Rather than add special cases in the Aptana source to deal with each of these specifically (and add more as they appear), it is preferable to extend the documentation languages' type expressions to include operators or new tags capable of explicitly stating a type's relationship to an identifier.      Because inference from simple assignments is now working quite well, the simplest solution might be a 'typeof' operator in ScriptDoc/SDocML/JSCA type expressions whose operand is a JavaScript expression.  The same inference code that is now working would evaluate the provided expression in the context of the invocation where it's found to determine the return type.",13

APSTUD-4452,"Use initialCapacity when generating collections in CollectionsUtil","Current CollectionsUtil#newMap/newSet/newList create their collections using the default constructors. However, this could cause more memory to be used than is needed to contain the items that will be added to them.

To avoid both of these issues, we should use the constructors that allow us to define an initial capacity, especially since we already know how many items are going to be added to the collections.",3

APSTUD-4455,"Use CollectionsUtil#newList/Map/Set where possible and/or set initialCapacity","To improve memory usage in our collections, we should see if we can switch over to using CollectionsUtil#new* methods directly since those methods will optimize the collection size to match its content.

Long-term we may want to handle freeing the strings from the pool in a smarter way when the referring elements themselves are removed (say a bundle gets removed) - but the effort required given that unusual/unlikely use case may not warrant it.    Secondly, we should use  StringPool for a lot of the duplicated string values in PHP builtins. We're already hanging onto the entire thing in memory, so having them live in a StringPool that lives as long as the plugin won't actually make it any worse.

APSTUD-4580,"PHP Outline broken by ""<"" (less than sign) character","The outline in the PHP editor is broken (i.e. outline is empty) when a ""<"" (less than sign) character is present between the opening/closing PHP tags.    I'm sure I haven't tested all possible scenarios, but the issue definitely presents itself when the ""<"" is directly followed by one or more a-z/A-Z characters    h2.Examples    The following code examples break the PHP outline    {code:php}  <?php    function test_func() {  	$x = '<a' .

Removal of a Task tag from the preferences window does not apply to currently open editors, clicking the apply button has no result as well.    Steps to reproduce:  1. Load a code file that is syntactically sound and has a TASK task on a single line comment. (for instance: jsexample.js)  2. Remove the TODO keyword.    Expected Results:  The TODO icon (clipboard) disappears from the line when the keyword is removed.    Actual Results:  The TODO icon is not removed until the file is reloaded.

APSTUD-4590,"Add support for union, intersection, and grouping operators to scope selectors","TextMate scope syntax supports '&', '|', and parenthesis to create more explicit scope selectors. Our current implementation supports ""descendant selector"", ',', and '-' (negative lookahead). In order to support these new operators, we will need to create a true parser. We should be able to use existing ISelectorNode (the AST nodes); however, there is a subtle difference between a descendant selector and the & operator. A descendant selector can match any segment from the current position within the scope to the end of the scope. The & operator is used for intersection, so it will need its own node type. Additionally, we will need a node for parenthesis to make it easier to reverse an AST back to source. We use the source for some types of equality testing.

Alternately, we could convert the binary data to an ASCII format, like base64, but in my opinion, the additional overhead of performing that conversion may defeat the benefit we would gain from using one of the binary formats directly. Another alternate might be to use a system next to indexing. That could be a separate file (or files) that contain the binary data where the entries in the index simply point to those files.",13

So I guess on my system Aptana the option 'Refresh using Native hooks or polling' is polling rather than hooks as it happens regardless of whether or not I'm doing anything.    I've traced it down to the 'Refresh using Native Hooks or Polling' which is under the Workspace menu. If I turn it off, the system quietens down and all is fine.     However, on a restart, this 'option' has reselected itself meaning (I guess) that the option is not reading it's setting correctly from the options saved (or perhaps isn't getting saved to the file?)    So the bug I'm reporting here is the preference can't be set beyond a restart and, of course, like all preferences it should be.    A second bug I guess is quite why the refresh of the workspace uses so much CPU - my system has 8000 files on a fairly old machine so I'm guessing it's hitting limits on my machine (results will of course vary on other machines). I've commented on that before (in the forums) and it was all fine in version 3 until now. I'll repeat my guess that there is a very inefficient method involved in the refresh of the workspace that still hasn't been resolved.     Anyway - hopefully to replicate ...    Type Workspace in to the preferences and select Workspaces at the bottom to get the ""Refresh ... "" option. Unselect it.

APSTUD-4703,"Fix revert system","When we deploy a new Aptana (or Titanium) release, we deploy it to a new location each time on Amazon S3, or to the same location (but wiping the old contents) on download.appcelerator.com. It appears that the P2 system now requires the old update site to exist in order to be able to revert to the previous version.    Suggest that we use the ""mirror"" task to merge in the previous versions (though Chris has suggested their might be a different approach to use as well)    {code}  <p2.mirror source=""${p2.build.repo}"">  	<destination kind=""metadata"" location=""${p2.repo.location}"" compressed=""${p2.compress}"" name=""${p2.metadata.repo.name}"" />  	<destination kind=""artifact"" location=""${p2.repo.location}"" compressed=""${p2.compress}"" name=""${p2.artifact.repo.name}"" />  	<slicingoptions includeoptional=""false"" />  </p2.mirror>  {code}    So, when deploying 3.1.1, we merge in 3.1.0.    We can keep the repos to merge in on the build server (we do them as tagged builds now) and update those references as part of updating version #s. However, maybe there is a better way to automatically figure out where these repos to merge in live.    h3. Suggested Fix  # Upgrade the two deployment scripts (the bash one for Titanium Studio and the Ruby release one for Studio 3) to take a list of versions and merge those into a new repo  # Upload the new repo to the same location as before  # Test the combined version by installing Version A, upgrading to version B, and being able to revert to version A (assuming A & B are both versions on the update site)",20

Working with something like Magento or anything based on ZF/Cake/Kohana etc means that you almost never create classes from scratch but are always extending someone else's class.    While inherited methods/properties are visible in autocomplete they do not show in the Outline view - so finding what's available in a large or an unknown project is a nightmare.     In contrast Aptana 1.5 showed all inherited methods/properties in the Outline view - see attached screen shot for an example of using this in a Magento project.    I still use Aptana 1.5 as my everyday IDE because the PHP Outline view does such a fantastic job of displaying and filtering through deep object hierarchies, I've tried (and purchased!) every other PHP IDE I can find to get a modern release that can beat it, and nothing can, it really is a killer feature.    Netbeans and PhpStorm both to a good job of letting you search for class usage etc but neither aid in exploring the hierarchy as well as the Aptana Outline view used to - please bring it back so I can upgrade to Studio 3!    Given that autocomplete already parses the hierarchy and Outline view already shows indented methods with a working filter system, it must be possible to render the hierarchy in Outline view.",13

This happens on every server at some point, and when this happens to Aptana I can connect using FileZilla or Dreamweaver and successfully FTP the same file.    The problem will fix itself automatically in about 20 minutes, possibly when the FTP connection has automatically timed out from the server. Restarting Aptana does not fix the problem. After time I can resume FTP normally but much time is lost waiting for these FTP errors to subside. This problem happens at least two or three times every day throughout my day.

APSTUD-4840,"Still Broken - Refresh using Native Hooks or Polling Can't be Turned off (reappears after reboot of machine)","This is a clone of bug APSTUD 4661 as I made the following comment on it, but I guess because that bug was deemed fixed, the comment went unnoticed. I've included the previous bug description after the new additional problem description.     The previous bug was not correctly fixed and the following describes the remaining, rather peculiar, issue.     I've upgraded to Aptana Studio 3, build: 3.1.2.201205041324 and have tested the following on Mageia 1.x and Ubuntu 12.04.    If I turn off the Refresh checkbox, save and view it again it remains off. If I close down Aptana and restart it, the checkbox remains off. If I close Aptana, log out, log back in again, and restart Aptana and view it, it remains off. The same is true if I don't close Aptana before logging out.    However, if I reboot my machine, log in and then restart Aptana, it is now back on again. In other words, the setting doesn't seem to survive a reboot.    I would guess this hints that the value is somehow being kept in memory and linux is reassigning that portion of memory to Aptana during the restarts of Aptana and even over a log out and log in again. Don't know if that is possible, but I can't imagine why it's misbehaving only on a reboot otherwise.    Steps to reproduce:  a) log in to either Mageia 1.x, or Ubuntu 12.04 or possibly other variants of linux or other OSes(haven't tested on those)  b) start up Aptana and turn OFF the Refresh button  c) REBOOT your machine  d) log in again and start up Aptana, and view the value. All things going well it's back on again.    Who'd have thought one checkbox could be so mysterious!!      The original bug description was ...      I've just upgraded to the latest aptana release (3.1.1.201204131931) and immediately hitting cpu usage issues with the CPU jumping to 90%ish every few seconds corresponding to a refresh of the workspace every few seconds. So I guess on my system Aptana the option 'Refresh using Native hooks or polling' is polling rather than hooks as it happens regardless of whether or not I'm doing anything.    I've traced it down to the 'Refresh using Native Hooks or Polling' which is under the Workspace menu. If I turn it off, the system quietens down and all is fine.     However, on a restart, this 'option' has reselected itself meaning (I guess) that the option is not reading it's setting correctly from the options saved (or perhaps isn't getting saved to the file?)    So the bug I'm reporting here is the preference can't be set beyond a restart and, of course, like all preferences it should be.    A second bug I guess is quite why the refresh of the workspace uses so much CPU - my system has 8000 files on a fairly old machine so I'm guessing it's hitting limits on my machine (results will of course vary on other machines). I've commented on that before (in the forums) and it was all fine in version 3 until now. I'll repeat my guess that there is a very inefficient method involved in the refresh of the workspace that still hasn't been resolved.     Anyway - hopefully to replicate ...    Type Workspace in to the preferences and select Workspaces at the bottom to get the ""Refresh ... "" option. Unselect it. Restart the studio, go back to that preference and you'll (hopefully) see it selected again.    I've attached two images - the first when I deselected the option. The second when I restarted showing the option has been selected again.",8

We could put the settings into jslint comments to make it work how we want it to, but that would require adding the settings to the 300+ JavaScript files that we have on our site.

In order to fix this I need to go to preferences > aptana studio > themes and press ""reset defaults"" *without changing anything*    Every time I start I need to go do that reset defaults.  I don't think it's the theme: something buggy happens when Aptana initializes that changes something in my settings.  Having to go through settings to undo it is lame, and it has to be a change that happened with the latest upgrade.  Please get someone to fix it... :)    -----    After latest upgrade, highlighted text color (PyDev editor) is opaque and changing theme colors does not work reliably.  All themes show behavior like the attached screenshot: the highlighted text foreground and background are the same color.  Changing selected foreground colors does not work as expected: selecting a dark-colored selection background results in a light-colored background.    Selecting the theme override for pydevOccurrenceIndication seems to fix the issue for the current session, but when I shut down Aptana and restart the highlight is broken again, even though the little 'B' icon next to pydevOccurrenceIndication is still selected.  I need to click it off and back on again to fix the highlight, which again only works until I restart.    I've been using Aptana without issues for at least 6 months prior to this issue, and have not touched color settings in months.  The latest update seems to have broken theme handling.    MOTE UPDATES: See screen2.png attached.  If you look closely, I selected a very dark gray(almost back) color for the line highlight and Aptana is using a bright gray.  Any color I choose for the line highlight is ignored, and Aptana chooses a much brighter color.  Aptana is just ignoring my setting for selected text altogether.      MORE UPDATES: I have had two instances today where I started Aptana, went in and changed pydevOccurrenceIndication so that I could see highlighted text (the broken same-background-and-foreground bug is 100% repeatable).  After switching to another window and switching back the highlight was broken again, requiring me to change the pydevOccurrenceIndication setting again.      This is profoundly irritating.  I hope whatever change broke color handling was awesome enough to cause this much pain.",5
APSTUD-4896,"PHP Autocompletion for parent methods + namespace","When you tried to access to parent methods which are in different namespace it doesn't work:  {code:php|borderStyle=solid}  <?php    namespace Package1;    class Foo {  	  	public function __construct(){  	}  	  	public function fooMethod(){  		  	}  }      namespace Package2;    class Foo extends \Package1\Foo {  	  	public function __construct(){  		parent:://Nothing is proposed while __construct() or fooMethod() should be listed  	}  }  {code}",13
APSTUD-4897,"The PHP parser should be improved to use the parse cache properly.","In PHP a problem collector is notified about errors during the parse and when the parse finishes, errors are reported, instead of working by adding problems found and later reporting them (after a parse).    So, it does not work properly if it takes advantage of the parsing (because in this case, the actual parsing won't take place -- and thus the error report won't happen).      Error reporting happens in:   com.aptana.editor.php.internal.parser.PHPParser.parse(IParseState, WorkingParseResult)  at the statement: ast.flushErrors();      Also, on revision afc72082e4ae14bedcc11a0c24053a45bdca5447, a cache with the 'last valid ast' was created inside the PHPParser, but this seems odd, as the parser will always return the last 'good' parse, but this is not correct in the following situation:    1. create 2 files (both with unrelated content but with errors)  2. close them  3. open one and fix the error  4. open the other one (already with the error): the php ast returned will be wrong as the one with the 'last good parse' will be returned    This would also break the ParsingEngine cache if it was in place because the parser would have the wrong ast returned.",20

The issue is demonstrated in the screencast I put together at http://youtu.be/5AJHkgKRrzk    I've updated to the latest Aptana Studio (v3.1.3) and that hasn't fixed it. (I was previously running v3.0.4)    I'm not sure if Aptana has built-in GIT so I also updated GIT for Windows to the latest 1.7.11-preview (was previously running v1.7.7). This also had no effect.    I've also got msysgit installed, I've upgraded that from 1.7.7 to 1.7.11 too.     As far as I know, this hasn't always been an issue. Though I may be wrong.  It now seems to be affecting all of my projects.    I've got a pretty standard, stand-alone Aptana Studio install - I've not added any plugins or extra modules to it.  And I use it in pretty basic ways to code using PHP.    The only things that may be unusual:   - I don't keep projects in my workspace folder, they're dotted all around my disk.   - I recently installed Eclipse as well - this seemed to be a fairly standalone thing that just popped a load of files in a directory. Is it possible that that's interfered with Aptana?  I don't know when this issue started, so it's hard to say if it started when I installed Eclipse.    I'm not sure what else you'll need to diagnose this. Let me know if you need any configs or .project files or anything.    Thanks    Ross Wintle",8

APSTUD-4974,"Interactive Console does not respect user keybindings","Eclipse allows you to set up your own keybindings for various contexts within the IDE, including the console. However, it appears that the PyDev interactive console doesn't respect these keybindings. It would be nice if the interactive console used Eclipse's commands API to make use of the user's keybindings for text editing (e.g. go to line start/end, etc.).    For example, I use keybindings based on Emacs.  So I can use Ctrl-A to jump to the start of a line, Ctrl+E to jump to the end of a line etc.  It would be really, really wonderful if these key bindings could also be activated for the interactive console, and the debugging console.

So, sometimes.. It cannot open declaration (not always, but sometimes), I cannot tell you how reproduce that bug, but, it's certainly reproductible.    For example, imagine that piece of php code, file is saved to the disk in a project:    {code}  <?php   // You can see the declaration of the constant JUST below:    define('TABLE_PRODUCTS_TO_DISCOUNT_CATEGORIES', 'products_to_discount_categories');    // Now, let's use the constant (tep or not tep_db):      $discount_category_query = tep_db_query(""select p.products_id, p.products_quantity, p.products_weight, discount_categories_id from "" .

It's not normal I think, since in olds versions of Aptana Studio 3.0.x this thing 'Open Declaration' opened my 'define' line. (and if the define was in other file, then Aptana just open the file and outline the define line! In Aptana Studio 3.2.x it just not effect, and if effect.. just report and error as showned up!).    Is it a bug or a normal new comportment? (can I revert to the old comportment?).    ",8

APSTUD-4980,"Debugging: Hovering over variables that are too long freezes Aptana","If you create a variable and make the value big enough AND WITH NO SPACES, the whole program freezes for about 1 minute, and then resumes as normal. It doesn't affect the rest of the computer. Aptana's ""debugging variable values hover box"" already truncates really long variables eg ""Hello World"" might become ""Hello W...."" however it can't handle massive variables with no spaces in it. If the variable is only a thousand characters long, there is only a 2 or 3 second freeze, however if it is several thousand chars long, the timespan would be several minutes, by which time a dev has already given up and closed the program with a Task Manager.  The problem seems trivial, however it is an issue for someone trying to calculate large numbers eg Pi to 5000 decimal places. there obviously wouldn't be any spaces in that value, therefore Aptana would freeze.

APSTUD-5030,"Simple Inline Conditionals for PHP","I posted this request a while ago on StackOverflow here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9414781/aptana-simple-inline-conditionals-for-php   It was suggested to post for an improvement here.    I'd like to use Aptana for its PHP formatting ability. However there is one improvement I'd like to see, which is an option to keep simple inline statements on one line.  The JavaScript editor does this for Eclipse, so I'd hope it's not too hard to replicate for Aptana (native).    The desired format is this:      if ($test == FALSE) return FALSE;    However, Aptana PHP Formatter formats the line like this:    if ($test == FALSE)      return FALSE;    This gets really annoying when you test anything more than 1 at a time:        if ($test1 == FALSE) return FALSE;      if ($test2 == 14) return FALSE;     if ($test3 == """") return FALSE;    becomes:      if ($test1 == FALSE)           return FALSE;      if ($test2 == 14)           return FALSE;      if ($test3 == """")           return FALSE;    sgibly responded with this:  There is no way to force it at the moment.

APSTUD-5031,"Support equivalent of Brackets.io ""Quick edit""","From Brackets' page:    Quick edit  One of the goals of Brackets is to make it easy to make quick edits to different bits of code without having to jump around between files.    Currently, Brackets has an early implementation of this. If you're in an HTML file, and you put the cursor inside a class or id attribute or a tag name, you can hit Ctrl/Cmd-E (for ""edit""). Brackets will search the CSS files in the file tree for relevant rules, then open up an inline editor embedded in the HTML file that lets you make quick tweaks to one of the rules.    On the right side of the inline editor, Brackets shows the list of all rules that might be relevant to the selected tag/class/id. You can switch between the rules by clicking on them in the list, or using Alt-Up/Down Arrow.    You can make changes in the inline editor and save them, then close the editor by hitting Cmd-E again. Edits you make in the inline editor will be properly applied in Live Development mode (see below).    Some things to note about this feature:    Brackets doesn't take the cascade, tag context, etc. into account.  Brackets doesn't check to see which CSS files are linked into the current HTML file--it searches all files in the file tree.  Eventually Brackets could leverage inline editing for lots of other kinds of things--in addition to showing relevant JS code, you could imagine adding inline visual tools like gradient and shadow editors for the selected CSS rule.",13

See: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/    The full support for this change includes:  1. AST change  2. Grammar change  3. Pretty-print    Note: it'll be done in the existing Python 3 grammar (as Python 3.2 is still not used a lot, we'll not create a separate 3.3 grammar just for that change -- so, there should be no changes in the UI).

APSTUD-5043,"Submit ticket 'Steps to Reproduce' lacks scrollbars.","h3. Steps to Reproduce  When this textarea (Steps to Reproduce) gets filled too far (vertically or horizontally), there are no scrollbars to let the user know he can scroll the text.    We should add the vertical bar but wrap the horizontal text so it's on the next line. This should apply to all multi-line text fields in the dialog.    h3. Actual Result  No scrollbars    h3. Expected Result  Scrollbars",3

APSTUD-7286,"Implement LRUCache with virtual memory paging scheme in editor infrastructure","Initially the main issue found is that the caching does not really work well with our multi-parsing strategy.    When a parse for a large document is done, say, an html with 30 css and 10 js partitions, each of those will end up requesting a new parse and as our parse cache is an LRU of size = 3, the cache is never used in this situation.    On the good side, once we get caches in place properly, when parsing a large document, we may have lots of sub-partitions already cached, which should make the parsing faster when reparsing the full html.    Ideas on approaches:    1. A simple approach is simply making the cache larger (say 256), but maybe we should have 2 different caches, one for 'outer' calls and another for 'internal' calls inside the parsing structure, but memory may be a problem here.    2. Or maybe a single cache where we have an LRU with a 'desired' max size but items are only prunned if not accessed for some time (say 10 seconds).    3. Having a SoftHashMap may be a reasonable replacement too.    4. Making proper use of the LRUCache implementation we have which implements a virtual memory paging scheme (each value may have an associated size and the LRU has a size related to that - the parsed document length may be a good tradeof in speed/size of the final generated AST).    Selected approach:    LRUCache with virtual memory paging scheme + SoftHashMap for pruned entries (which may be restored if still alive).",13

APSTUD-7477,"Adjust JS index keys to be inline with expected usage","When we decided to make use of the same index format as JDT, we expected to also retain similar usage. JS usage of the index falls pretty far outside of that by effectively serializing properties/functions/events/event properties using JSON. This can lead to very large ""keys"" and can make it nearly impossible to do easy queries using patterns for particular attributes.    Currently we store type, function, property, event, require. The first four are simply the declarations. The last is a very specific instance of recording references to the 'require' function/method.    JDT typically stores declarations with more details, but also stores references to types/fields/methods; and records references to supertypes/interfaces separate from the type declaration. Additionally, declaration keys are typically simple and compact.    JDT:  {code}  type decl: typeName / packageName / enclosingTypeName / modifiers (modifiers are packed as an int, using 2 chars - and represent combo of class/interface/enum/annotation flag/markers)  super ref: superSimpleName / superQualification / simpleName / enclosingTypeName / typeParameters / pkgName / superClassOrInterface classOrInterface modifiers  field ref and decl: fieldName  method: name / arity (arity is the arg/parameter count)  {code}    Studio:  {code}  property: name, description, since, user-agents, owning type, isClass, isInstance, isInternal, deprecated, types, examples  function: all from property plus isConstructor, isMethod, parameters, returnTypes, exceptions, references.    parameters (included in function): name, types, usage, description    return-types/types: type, description    exception: type, description  event: name, description, since, user-agents, owning type, properties, deprecated    event property: name, description, since, user-agents, type, deprecated  {code}    Obviously we store much more information and we expect to fully serialize the metadata from the index, whereas JDT uses the index for matching and then opens the defining document/file and parses to reconstruct when more details are necessary. Additionally we store type inferencing data in the index where JDT doesn't need to (it records type info in relavent index categories, but doesn't need to for fields/vars/methods as it can always easily look it up).    The open question is whether we can do the same - and to do so what sort of information will we need to record in the index and what can we lookup on-demand? ",40

Can we alter the validation so it includes this?  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Attribute_selectors  http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#attribute-selectors    W3C spec states:  [att*=val]  Represents an element with the att attribute whose value contains at least one instance of the substring ""val"". If ""val"" is the empty string then the selector does not represent anything.  Screen shot included  ---------    Attribute selector values inside a :not() argument do not validate. For example:  audio:not([controls]) { display: none; } < does not validate although it should.   Aptana Studio doesn't seem to like the [controls] as an argument, although [controls] means any audio element with the controls attribute. This is perfectly valid. - Please see (w3c) link above.

In fact, related perhaps, Aptana does not actually close when I quit either.    The only way I can use Aptana again is by force closing through the Mac OS force close interface. It will then open and ask my which workspace I want.    I have about 6 workspaces I switch between frequently. Prior to the upgrade I did not have any problems switching spaces.    Also noticed that the ""connections"" node is missing as is the App Explorer tab.    Developing js, html, css and php (no python, no mobile apps, no mysql).
