TISTUD-112,"Clean doesn't actually clean a mobile project","We need to make ""Clean"" actually remove the contents of both the build/iphone and build/android directories (but not the directory itself).  This will cause a real clean when you build the project and regenerate compiled files. ",1

There is no scripting support for updating the resources directory by a new set of targets. To avoid any user confusion, we should probably hide those targets or gray them out with some info about the problem. ",1
TISTUD-215,"App Explorer view should transition to the Debug perspective","When the user opens a debugging session, and switches to the debug perspective, only the Eclipse Debug button is left for re-launching the application while still in the Debug perspective. This makes the user experience somewhat inconsistent because (presumably) they will be launching from the Debug button inside the App Explorer (""Titanium"" perspective).

TISTUD-273,"Allow selection by CamelCase","In another I-can't-name-it Eclipse based IDE, there's a feature where you can select things based on CamelCase, instead of by word, which is very handy.    Example: If I have code like this:    /pintley/ui/components/MoreRow.js    On OS X, if I put my cursor between ""Row"" and "".js"", hold down option-shift, and hit the left arrow, it would highlight ""Row"" instead of ""MoreRow"".

The syntax for starting and stopping the server is pretty straight forward:  $MOBILESDK/android/fastdev.py start <path/to/project> $MOBILESDK/android/fastdev.py stop <path/to/project>  You can check if the server is running by looking for an existing lock file in:  <path/to/project>/.fastdev.lock",1

This enables the ""run on simulator"" for iOS, and in my test was able to launch the project in the simulator.     Steps to reproduce:  1) Create a new Titanium Mobile project in Studio  2) Select ""Android"" as the only deployment target  3) When the project is created, open TiApp.xml and note that only Android is available to select/deselect  4) Open the pure xml tab of TiApp.xml and set deploy target for iOS to ""true""    Result:  Your project can be launched in the simulator, but installed on device will launch then quit and has no icon.    Expected:  Either no ability to add or remove targets after project creation or the ability to add with the same default structure as during project creation.    Suggested solution:    * user checks platform option in tiapp.xml  * Call platform script to initialize new platform.

Steps to Reproduce:    1. Create a new project using 1.8.0.1.  2. Open tiapp.xml in the TiApp Editor.  3. Change the runtime to Rhino (this creates an entry in the xml where there was none before: <property name=""ti.android.runtime"">rhino</property>).  4. Change the runtime to V8 (this changes the contents of the xml property line).  5. Change the SDK version (in TiApp Editor) to pre-1.8.0.1 (e.g., 1.7.5).    Expected Result:  Rhino should be the default runtime.    Actual Result:  V8 is the default runtime (invalid).    Note:  If you select a pre-1.8.0.1 SDK without first selecting a different runtime (thus adding the property line to the xml), the default runtime is correctly changed to Rhino in the TiApp Editor.",8

Don't worry about fleshing them out fully. Instead, take Chris's feedback and Thomas's feedback (shown below) to create a set of test scenarios at the top of the file and run through those. We will leave the creation of exhaustive test cases to later when we have more QA resources.  * Review the unit tests. See if they exercise the functionality. Run them through Emma to check for code coverage  * Run the test scenarios and file any bugs found.    To Test:  Checkout the ""participant"" branch of studio3, studio3-ruby and studio3-php    Thomas's feedback:  * All tests are marked as full. The point of a test plan is to break functionality into smoke, acceptance and full levels of test. If the tester can't figure out these coverage levels, they need to work with dev to figure it out.  * Resource requirements are not filled out - now way of knowing from this plan what Os are being tested or targeted  * An actual description of what ""Build Participant functionality"" is would be helpful if the test plan is going to be run by anyone other than the author. There seems to be multiple features in the test cases  * No risks or assumptions are filled out  * Often missing set up steps - For the PHP and Ruby specific test cases, how do we setup our environment to test those test cases?  * Under genericized tests, it says ""Applicable to all languages."" Which programming languages is being tested: JS, Java, Objective C?  * Unclear if it applies to Aptana or Tistudio.   * Not seeing links to any dev specs: http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tis/Participating+in+the+build+and+reconcile+process    Ignore for now:    * Overall, the test cases should be more detailed since the test plan seems to be dealing with different programatic syntax and the test plan needs to clearly define what it is testing. (ignore for now)  * Not sure of why the tests at the top are repeated from 1012 on with a ""syntactically sound"" js file. Is there a target for this specific set of tests?  * In the ""Declarations and documentation"" tests, need specific examples for the programatic syntax (e.g. Document a class, declare a class, declare a function etc.)  * 1112 - 1115 refer to Aptana Studio. Also the location is Mac-only for the preferences. Unless the testing is Mac only either leave out the menu path or put Linux and Win info too.  ",21

TISTUD-1058,"Titanium Studio: Improved error reporting in preferences window for invalid Android SDK","I had a bad Titanium SDK install. Not entirely sure how it happened, but the end result was some files were missing or corrupt. The end result was that, in the Titanium Preferences, I was getting an error saying that no Android SDK was found at my android sdk path. Upon much hand-wringing, eventually I was told to look at the Titanium log, which had an error ""!MESSAGE (Build 1.0.0.1326828513) [ERROR]  /usr/bin/python: can't open file '/Users/shan/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.8.1.v20120123161633/android/avd.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory"", which made the problem pretty obvious.    It would be great if:    1. Titanium Studio would have alerted me that there was an error, instead of saying that my Android SDK could not be found.  2. If that can't easily be accomplished, the error text displayed on the Preferences screen should have ""Check the Titanium Studio log for more information."" appended to it.",13

Suggest is we have some way to allow snippets to be scoped based on project natures (i.e. titanium mobile), or perhaps a more generic mechanism (i.e. jquery snippets enabled in a ""jquery"" project, where there is no corresponding nature)    Suggestion is to add a meta scope of: meta.project.<nature>",20
TISTUD-1073,"Improve performance when the Snippets view is initially loaded","I profiled the performance issue. The root cause is creation of all the snippets when the view is loaded. A solution would be to lazy load the creation of the snippets until they are shown.

Just need to make sure ""mobileweb"" is added to the call if the mobile web checkbox is checked.    Side effects of not specifying this argument today is that the mobileweb resources folder will not get copied into the project's resources folder and then the appicon, favicon, apple touch icons, and apple startup images won't be displayed in the app.  Undoubtedly there will be more logic performed during project creation in the future, so we need to have this argument added.

TISTUD-1115,"Studio: Android SDK detection relies on script in latest Titanium SDK in mobilesdk folder, giving misleading info during failure","Description:  To determine if the Android SDK is properly configured, Studio relies on a script (avd.py I believe) in the latest Titanium SDK in the Titanium SDK folder. This is problematic in some circumstances including when a developer installs a development Titanium SDK. Studio will automatically defer to this new version for verification of the correct configuration of the Android SDK. If there is an issue with the script or some other problem with the folder structure of the development Titanium SDK, it will disable the ability of Studio to use Android projects. Since it is not possible for QE to verify every development release has the correct structure and that the and.py script is present and functional, this is a potential risk area.    Steps to reproduce:  1) Configure studio to have 1.8.0.1 GA as the latest SDK  2) Install an SDK from master branch (1.9.0)  3) navigate to the folder for the 1.9.0 SDK and remove SDK FOLDER/android/avd.py  4) In studio, select the titanium preference pane or click ""configure..."" from the TIapp.xml overview    Result:  Android preference states ""Could not locate the Android SDK at the given path""    Expected:  Android SDK configuration verification based on method that is independent of Titanium SDK",13

The icons however seem to have some room for improvement. There are two main areas for evaluation:  1) The iOS icons seem to generate confusion for two reasons: First, the Apple icon is cropped to the point that it is difficult to recognize it as an apple. Second, the three letters used to signify iPad and iPhone are difficult to decipher: ""iPa"" and ""iPh"".  2) While most OSes have the header in white, Linux is grey, making the Android icon difficult to make out as the contrast is too low.    An additional concern may be the sourcing of the icons    Steps to reproduce:  1) Install Studio 2.0 on any system (linux for Android icon contrast evaluation)  2) Create a new project  3) Edit the TiApp.xml  4) Note the Module section in the editor overview    Result:  Icons less than ideal    Expected:  Icons are beautiful",5

TISTUD-1366,"Only check apiversion tag in manifest for Android modules","iPhone modules are displayed as not supported when the Titanium SDK version is set to version 1.8.0.1 or newer. This appears to be due to the fact that the manifest file for iPhone modules currently do not include the 'apiversion: 2' entry. The 'apiversion' entry was added for Android modules in Titanium SDK version 1.8.0.1 to indicate that the internal module API had changed. This change only impacted Android modules and it should be checked for Android modules because older versions of Android modules will not work with Titanium SDK version 1.8.0.1 or newer (and vice-versa). This is not the case for iPhone modules (currently).    The check for the 'apiversion' tag should ONLY be done for Android modules. It should be ignored for iPhone modules.    To test:    # Create a new Titanium Mobile project  # Open up tiapp.xml and add a module to the project using the modules panel (I used ti.greystripe). Note the module appears active  # Edit the module manifest file to raise the apiversion to something like ""3"" in the iOS and Android (current maximum version is 2 for 1.8/2.0)  # Save tapp.xml and restart Studio.

We investigated, and noted that manipulating the pop-up for the SDK version would warn that the file had changed on the file system,and did she want to sync. With Shalom running us through some tests we determined a few things, most disconcerting is the fact that the Tiapp XML view had a different SDK listed than showed in the Overview. This explained the issue with building with the wrong SDK.    We still are investigating why the TiApp.xml is showing as out of sync from the file system perspective.    Steps to reproduce:  1) Install and run Studio  2) Create a project and build for device  3) Open TiApp.xml editor and change SDK then save  4) Continue to change SDK and save until you get warned about file system sync    Result:  After a few moments you should see the sync warning.

TISTUD-1395,"Running package operations (on multiple platforms) on the same project multiple times causes errors","Since package operations are now public launch configurations, you can run multiple configurations in quick succession. This will cause errors since the package operations operate on the build directory. We should queue up the launch configurations so they are sequential, scheduling launches based on the project.    Steps:  1. Create a mobile project with iOS, Android and mobile web deployment targets  2. Perform project package for iOS  3. Perform project package for android  4. Perform project package for mobile web  5. From the run shortcut, re-run 2/3/4 operations multiple times    Expected:  Each package operation completes successfully    Actual:  Error occurs",8

Running the command can be foreign and difficult for some users. We should display a informative description and link on how to run xcode-select. There should be a linked wiki/doc page that describes in further detail on how to run the command.     The description should be included in the iOS section of the Titanium preferences.

TISTUD-1407,"Add platform attribute to module element(s)","When a module that supports only a single platform is added to a project using the new modules table, the module element is added to tiapp.xml but it is missing the platform tag.     Steps to reproduce:    1. Create a new mobile application project -- use defaults of all application target types  2. Click on the button to add a new module (+)  3. Select a module that is only available on one platform (e.g. ti.push)  4. Save the project  5. Attempt to run the application in the iPhone simulator  6. Build should fail with an error indicating that the ti.push module is missing    Without the 'platform' tag on the module entry, the build script will attempt to locate the module for all application targets. The module element needs to include the 'platform' tag so that the module is only searched for when building for that target. For example, 'platform=""android""'.     Also, without the 'platform' tag the module displays in the Modules table with its version number available on all platforms -- which is incorrect since it is only available on the single platform.

We conducted a few experiments and determined that although the module was updated, the name was the same so during the unzipping process, the module was not replacing the existing older module.    Steps to reproduce:  1) Delete your existing common JS module folder from the Titanium folder  2) install a CI build from 3/24 or before  3) Check the contents of the module folder  4) install a CI build from 3/27 or later  5) Check the contents of the module folder    Results:  The ti.cloud module is the older broken module, not the newer fixed module    Expected:  The module is overwritten by the newer module with the same name.

It claims to have performance increases beyond the standard emulator making for a better development experience.    h2. Proposed Solution(s)    It would be good if you could specify by default whether you want to use the x86 or standard emulator for all projects, perhaps in {{Preferences -> Titanium Studio -> Titanium}}. It should be the standard emulator by default as the x86 emulator currently does not include the Google APIs (which would prevent the KitchenSink from running) and it does not support V8, as detailed in the linked ticket.    Also, it should be configurable on a per-project basis as well, for the same reasons I listed in the above paragraph.    So:    # We need to upgrade our AVI detection to show the available ABIs per device  # For devices with multiple ABIs we need to allow the user to select which one to use as part of the launch configuration, and that is passed as the first argument to the SDK for SDKs 2.1+. For < 2.1, we only pass the device argument  # We could add a preference in Titanium Preferences to default to x86 or standard emulator (were available).

The old project options are still available (e.g., Close is available if the project is already closed).    Re-clicking the project in the explorer will update the Project menu options.    This is not a regression. There is no log info.    Fail Cases:    1. Project Explorer: Cannot open a newly closed project.  2. Project Explorer: Cannot close a newly opened project.    Note: Project Explorer: Cannot close a freshly created project. - This is an invalid case as tiapp.xml has focus.    Steps to Reproduce:    1. Click a project in Project Explorer to manually refresh Project menu options.  2. Click Project > Close to close project.  3. Click Project.    Expected Result:    Project > Open should be available.    Actual Result:    Open is not available. If the project is re-clicked, it will become available.    4.

It is expected the selected project in the App Explorer would only change if it is deleted or manually changed.    However, the App Explorer selected project is not updated (correctly) if a new project is created.    This is not a regression. There is no log info.    Steps to Reproduce:    1. Create two projects.  2. In the App Explorer, select the first project.  3. In the Project Explorer, select the second project.  4. Close the second project using Project > Close.  5. Open the project using Project > Open (reselect project if Project menu commands do not update).  6. Navigate to the App Explorer.

Search > Search brings up the search menu.  Search > File... brings up the search menu with identical settings.  There is a second tab in the search menu for PyDev that is not selectable from the command drop-down list.    Eclipse Behavior:    In Eclipse, there are three search options (Search, File..., and JavaScript...).  Search > Search brings up the search menu with the JavaScript tab selected.  Search > File... brings up the search menu with the File tab selected.  Search > JavaScript... brings up the search menu with the JavaScript tab selected.  There is a third Java tab that exists in the menu, but is not accesible from a drop-down command.    The issue is Titanium should either remove Search > File... because it brings up a duplicate menu, or add Search > PyDev... to access the PyDev tab in the search menu.    This is not a regression. There is no log info.    Steps to Reproduce:    1. Open Studio.  2. Go to the Search drop-down menu at the top.    Expected Result:    Search > File... should not exist, or Search > PyDev... should exist.    Actual Result:    Search > Search and Search > File... bring up identical menus.",8

Create a new project, open app.js.  2. Highlight an arbitrary block of code (and keep it highlighted).  3. Go to Preferences > Titanium Studio > Themes.  4. Change the theme to iLife 05 (for example). Click apply.  5. Move the preference window to view app.js.    Expected Result:    Highlighting alpha should be correctly applied.    Actual Result:    Highlighting alpha is not working. If the preference is accepted and the file is used, highlighting will be broken until the app is reopened.  This is an intermittent issue.",8

This can result in multiple preference windows being launched.    This is not a regression.    This does not affect Windows 7 or Snow Leopard.    This does not affect Eclipse on Ubuntu.    Steps to Reproduce:prav    1. Open studio.  2. Open a menu window (e.g., Preferences, Search).  3. Click on the top menu bar (i.e., File, Edit, etc.).    Expected Result:    The top menu bar should not receive any click events.    Actual Result:    The top menu bar can receive events. However, the main editor frame is correctly blocked from receiving events.    As a consequence, many info windows can be launched multiple times (i.e., Search, About).

This is not a regression. There is no log.    This is related to TISTUD-1666, but this is a separate edge case.    Steps to Reproduce:    1. Create a new project.  2. Create a new module.  3. Package the module to the project.  4. Delete the module from the project using TiApp Editor Overview (click the red X to delete module).    This will dirty the tiapp.xml file and remove the module xml tags, but keep the module folder in the project.    5. While the editor is still dirty, package the module again to the project.    Expected Result:    Module should package and appear in TiAPP Editor Overview, xml tags for the module should exist in the tiapp.xml file.    Actual Result:    Module packages, but does not appear in the TiAPP Editor Overview. The xml tags are not generated.    It is worth noting the module tags will be added if the tiapp.xml file is dirty from other kinds of edits (i.e., changing the app version from 1.0 to 2.0).",8

Open the ticket submission form (Help > Titanium Studio > Submit a Ticket)    Expected result:  The Username portion should be correctly spaced out and be pleasing to look at.

TISTUD-1950,"Replace Message dialog notifying background job complete with toast popup","This is related to TISTUD-1817, where we tracked down the locations that opened up a Message dialog from a background thread. A more elegant method of displaying the notification is to use a popup toast to notify the user. The popup should only be used for INFO messages, for Question and Error we should still use the Message dialog    Locations that this affects:  -iOS/Android/MobileWeb project packaging  -iOS/Android/MobileWeb module packaging (normal and deploy to project with changes)  -Titanium SDK update  -Publish  -Android SDK update (dashboard)",8

There is only a pop-up indicating Android was downloaded successfully.    Note that studio automatically detects JDK to run, but it does not forward this information to the Android SDK tools.    There is no log info.    This is not a regression. This is a usability issue.    Steps to Reproduce:    1. Make sure JDK is installed.  2. Remove JAVA_HOME from the Global Environment Variables.  3. Make sure JAVA_HOME is no longer active (i.e., echo %JAVA_HOME%, echo $JAVA_HOME from the console).  4. Run Titanium Studio.  5. Make sure the Android SDK path is set in the Titanium Studio Preferences.  5. Run Dashboard > Configure > Android > Install/Update.    Actual Result:    A pop-up appears indicating Android was downloaded successfully every time Update is run.    Expected Result:    Either the Android SDK Update utility should run,  Titanium Studio should set JAVA_HOME,  or Titanium Studio should prompt the user to set JAVA_HOME.",8

TISTUD-1973,"Titanium Studio: SDK Updates: canceling extraction does not produce a warning","During an SDK update, if the extraction process is canceled, there is no longer an error message generated.    This is a regression. This worked in 2.1.0.    It is worth noting (not part of the regression) that the partially extracted SDK remains in the SDK folder, resulting in an invalid SDK.    When the SDK is in this invalid state:    It is still selectable by titanium projects, and   if it is a stable release, it will not be recognized as needing an update.    Steps to Reproduce:    1. Download any version of the SDK using a method such as:    Help > Check for Titanium SDK Updates or  Help > Install Specific Titanium SDK...    2. During the extraction process (which occurs after the downloading/fetching process), press 'Cancel'.    Actual Result:    No error dialog, no error logs.    Expected Result:    Error dialog pop-up and error logs, with a button allowing the user to open an explorer/finder window to the extracted location on disk (if they wish to remove it themselves)",8

Unable to locate Java VM. Please set JAVA_HOME environment variable.  [ERROR] Unabled to prepare JavaScript for packaging. Error code 4.  {noformat}    I check and the $JAVA_HOME is set, but was not available to the Python script. Studio should check for the JAVA_HOME before beginning a build, check if it is correctly set, and if it is missing or incorrect pass in a correct version into the build.    This issue is a not a regression since the bug is due to a user mis-configuration of JAVA_HOME.    Steps used to reproduce:  1. Ensure that the $JAVA_HOME global variable is set ( ls -R $JAVA_HOME ).  2. Create a new Titanium Mobile Project.  3. Create a signing key.  4. Package for Distribution (Package > Distribute - Android App Store)    Expected result:  Android correctly packages and a package file is created in the specified place.    Actual result:   The packager gets to titanium_prep.linux64 where it can not find java as $JAVA_HOME isn't available to it.    Tested by multiple sources on Titanium Studio build 2.1.1, 2.1.0, and 2.0.2 on both Ubuntu 12.04 and 10.04, using SDK 2.1.0GA replicated the same failure. Switching back to SDK 2.0.2GA fixes the issue in all studio platforms, as 2.1.0 is the first version to use JAVA_HOME in the packaging scripts.    Suggested solution:  * See if JAVA_HOME is set in such a way that the scripts can read it  * If it is, check if the JAVA_HOME variable is correct by checking for /lib/tools.jar at that path  * If it is incorrectly set, or not set, infer the JAVA_HOME location by using values from Studio's environment.",13

TISTUD-2563,"Add extension point for contributing programmatic project templates","Currently we ""hack"" in support for alloy templates by registering templates programmatically during an IStartup.

After that finishes we then get a prompt to install acs using a different prompt UI (but again for sudo password). We should have a consistent UI for prompting the sudo password. Additionally, since less than my sudo password expiration time passed between the two, hopefully I wouldn't even get prompted (for my password, but maybe for acceptance) the second time.",5
TISTUD-2576,"Unify the handling of installing and updating processes","Our handling of installing requirements are pretty inconsistent. We have the Titanium SDK Updater which checks on startup for updates to Titanium SDK, titanium CLI, alloy, and acs. But we also have separate IStartup checks for acs and alloy. Additionally our check for Node is done entirely separately.    Ideally we'd have the check for updates _always_ run regardless of prefs. And we should have the notion of required installs versus optional (so user can ignore updates that aren't required, but must install/update required things).",13

TISTUD-2797,"Offer content assist on TSS keys - classes and IDs","We need to offer up content assist for the keys of the JSON-like objects in TSS files. This ticket specifically addresses offerring up the list of classes and IDs found in the view files.    {code}  <!-- index.xml -->  <Label id=""myLabel""/>    // index.tss  ""#myLabel"": {      text: 'some text'  }  {code}    The {{""#myLabel""}} token is what we'd suggest. IDs use a {{#}} prefix like in CSS, and classes use {{.}}.    The list of classes and ids is found by querying the indexed values from TISTUD-2798.    app.tss should query all files. For other tss files we can limit the scope to just the associated view (same hierarchy and basename).",8
TISTUD-2798,"Index Alloy view XML files to record id and class declarations with type info","We'll need to begin indexing alloy's XML files to record the list of classes and ids used. This will then be used for TSS code assist.    The involves adding a new IndexBuildParticipant for XML files. In the participant we may filter when we activate to only projects with alloy nature and files under app/views/. The participant would parse the XMl file and traverse the AST to get the class/id attribute info.    When we record a class or id reference, we will likely also want to record the fully qualified type name of the element it is on.    {code}  <!-- index.xml -->  <Alloy>    <Window> <!-- implicit id of ""index"" -->      <Label id=""myLabel""/>    </Window>  </Alloy>  {code}    In this case we'd record that index.xml has a Titanium.UI.Label with an id value of ""myLabel"". The type is required to determine the property list in TSS content assist, as well as content assist in controller JS. The type namespace mapping is the same as in TISTUD-2783.    Please note that the top-level widget (the child under the {{<Alloy>}} tag) in a view has an implicit id of the file's basename, so the top-level {{Window}} of index.xml would have an id of ""index"").",8

We should take the string which is the key of the surrounding object, convert it to a fully qualified type name (see TISTUD-2783), then query the list of properties for that type.    If the string is not the name of a type, but is a class or id, we need to query the class/id index from the view files to resolve it to the type it is hanging off.",8

Additionally, those files are ""contributed"" to the list run through our builder for a project. So they get merged into the project's index itself. For each build entry we should be able to point at a single file or a directory tree, and then index all of it. Each entry should be recorded into it's own index file, so multiple projects referencing the same entry can reuse the same index (i.e. Titanium SDK 2.1.4GA API).

This information is not requested when running in emulator or on device. If the android builder.py is not passed a keystore it uses the default keystore shipped with the SDK.    The issue with this is that people who wish to use an app key, for say Google maps v2, are directed to use the default keystore to generate a debug key, and to generate their own keystore to create a production key.    This could eventually lead to situations where multiple keys are associated with the same keystore on the google side.    Steps to reproduce:  1) Create an android project in studio  2) Attempt to package the project - note the dialog requesting Keystore info  3) Attempt to run on device    Result:  THe default keystore is used since no keystore passed to builder.py.

TISTUD-3981,"Alloy Debugger: wrong behavior setting breakpoints on functions under Android","h5. Problem description  Debugger is not correctly handling a breakpoint set for a function in the controller .js file    h5. Steps to reproduce  Android OS tested: 2.3.6 Nexus One, Android emulator    See the sample attached.    h6. index.xml  {code}  <Alloy>  	<Window class=""container"">  		<Label id=""label"" onClick=""doClick"">Hello, World</Label>  	</Window>  </Alloy>  {code}    h6. index.js  {code}  function doClick(e) {    	      alert($.label.text);    }    $.index.open();  {code}    1. Set a BreakPpoint at line 3 for the'alert($.label.text);'  2. Debug the App on Android     Result: App starts but the breakpoint is immediately triggered before displaying the Window (so just the splashscreen is displayed) and without having to click on the label.    From the Debug tab, it looks the behavior is wrong and that actually the wrong line is highlighted, focusing on the 'doClick() function' instead of the 'alert' function inside.    See the two screenshots, one for Android (wrong behavior), one for iOS (correct one, being triggered only when clicking on the sample 'label' for displaying the alert, not when starting the App).    3. Click to go past the breakpoint. Manually click on the app label to trigger the alert again.  Result: breakpoint is now ignored. Alert is being displayed.      Attaching Debugger log, where there is this line (not present in the iOS debugger log):  {code}  [57:33.986] Recv: >1364417853985*!unknown option <monitorXHR><  {code}    Attaching Android build.log too",8

'Resources' folder is by default not visible for Alloy projects on Studio, so the default result is also that the project is marked with an error icon, but the user can't see any other red error icon next to any visible Project file.    Also, having an error or a warning reported for the Alloy compiled code in the Resources folder is not adding much value for the user as the intended behavior is not to manually modify the compiled code files in the Resources (user should only handle Alloy files, all included into the App folder).    h5. Steps to reproduce    Paste the sample code. Note the code error in the controller.js , where foobar is actually not a function.  The error is correctly reported by the Code Analyzer (see the screenshot), also getting the correct position in the Alloy project.  However, in Studio the Error icon is placed in 'Resources/alloy/controllers/index.js' , which is hidden by default and should in any case manually modified by the user.    h6. controller/index.js  {code}  $.mainwin.foobar({  	backgroundColor : 'blue'  });      $.index.open();  {code}    h6. index.xml  {code}  <Alloy>  	<Window title=""Win 1"" id='mainwin'>  		<Label>I am Window 1</Label>  		<Button>Click</Button>  	</Window>  </Alloy>  {code}      h5. Note  Alloy projects could also be displaying errors or warning relative to compiled code, generated by Alloy, not necessarily linked to ""App"" alloy files created by the user but only present in ""Resources"" folder.",8

Debug on Device: Android and iOS: log level not respected.    Sometimes the old console log level is used instead of trace.    Note this ticket might be invalid, as we might actually want to use the existing console level.    Also note the device run config does not allow the user to select a preferred default log level.    This does not appear to be a regression.

If TISTUD-4882 is fixed, this ticket may no longer have the same severity.    Test Steps:    1. Launch app in Device Debug mode.  2. Change log level in console view.    Result:    No effect. Intermittently the default log level is not trace, but the previous log level from the existing console.

TISTUD-5295,"Add diagnostic tests for troubleshooting npm configuration issues","If any user has npm installation issues either with or without prefix configured, then it might not be very easy to judge the problem on the user's machine, especially with npm prefix configuration.    Instead of asking user each time to run a series of commands on their machine to figure out the underlying problem, we can add those commands in the diagnostic tests and that should let us give a fair idea on what is going on user's machine with just the diagnostic test logs.    When the NPM updates are invoked, either during startup or by the user -    1) It verifies whether the package is installed on the machine using 'npm -g ls <package>' command.  1.1) If the above command fails for any reason, then invokes 'npm -p ls -g'  2) If the package is available on the machine, it figures out the installed version and latest available version using 'npm view <package> version' command.    Also, since PREFIX is one of those dark areas, we need to add the prefix configuration to the diagnostic logs.    1) Environment variable : Get the system property for NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX  2) Get the prefix key from the npm configuration : npm config get prefix  3) If only the environment variable is set, then the local prefix config value differs from the global one. That can lead to discrepancies in the installation of npm packages. So we should get the output for : 'sudo npm config get prefix'. However, since we don't hold user's password, this might not be a feasible value to store in the diagnostic tests.",5

The issue generally manifests itself first as a dialog show in the attachment ""firstDialog.png""    This prevents studio users from being able to build with Android.    h5. Steps to reproduce:  1) Use Titanium Studio 3.1.3  2) Install CLI 3.2.0 using:  ""sudo npm install -g git://github.com/appcelerator/titanium.git""   3) Install SDK 3.2.0 (CLI currently has an issue, so use Studio)  4) Set CLI selected SDK to 3.2.0 with:  ""ti sdk select <insert your 3.2.0 SDK version string here>""  5) Restart studio  -additional note: you can use command ""ti info -o json -t android"" to see the difference in the structure of the payload regarding the Android SDK.    h5. Result:  You may see the ""computing SDK info"" error first. The Android SDK is no longer configured correctly and Studio will prompt the user to specify the Android SDK install location when trying to build for Android. Studio dashboard shows Android SDK as not configured.     h5. Expected Result:  Android SDK still working and user is able to build for Android.  ",5

TISTUD-5452,"Modify launch shortcuts to use device profiles rather than generic iPad/iPhone sim targets","We currently have generic ""iPhone Simulator"", ""iPad Simulator"", ""Android Emulator"" shortcuts defined for generating pre-canned launch configs.     We need to move towards pre-defined ""device profiles"". The first step is replacing these generic shortcuts with ones for target devices, like ""iPhone 3.5-inch"" or ""iPhone 4"" (the same listing as XCode). These launch shortcuts will pre-populate the config attributes to toggle tall/retina/etc flags for the user.",8
TISTUD-5453,"Modify the config UIs to have combo boxes for device profiles rather attribute checkmarks for tall/retina","Once we have device profiles defined (by CLI, and given to us by ""ti info""?). We should replace the current UI we have in launch configs for tall/retina with a combobox to select from the device profiles.    We should ""migrate"" existing configs to pre-select the most applicable/relevant device based on settings.    We'll likely also need to pass the device name down to the CLI (or expand out it's args and pass those?)",8
TISTUD-5454,"Collapse the Run/Debug/Profile/Test/Package icons into UI like XCode/Momentics","We have each mode broken out as it's own pulldown menu. We should adopt the XCode/Momentics UI where there's a giant ""play""/Run button that is pulldown to select mode (and clickable to launch), and then a trailing combo with the shortcuts/targets to launch.    Decision is to not mimic the big stop button for now (and handle version later).    This will be available in the global toolbar, and the corresponding icons will be removed from local toolbar of App/Project Explorer.",8
TISTUD-5455,"Remember last mode/config per-project and change UI to last one when project selection changes","Once we have the new UI, we should remember the last launched mode/target/config for each project and when project selection changes reset the Ui to match the last chosen for that project.",5
TISTUD-5457,"Combine update mechanisms","We currently have two major update mechanisms, prompts and UIs. We have our own for NPM packages, Node, SDK - and then we have the standard eclipse p2 mechanism for updating Studio and plugins.    The result is two separate prompts, two separate UIs and an inconsistency in installation. We want to only prompt once, all at the same time and be able to resolve dependencies between the two systems (i.e. if the CLI makes a breaking change that requires a new studio update).  ",8
TISTUD-5459,"Combine our update popups","We currently have two separate update popups/checks: one is the Eclipse p2 update check and will update Studio itself. The second is our own check for updates to NPM packages, the SDK and other modules/components.    This results in an inconsistent UI. We should ideally update Studio through the same update check job and UI.    There are wiki pages devoted to how you can alter p2 behavior at http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Adding_Self-Update_to_an_RCP_Application#Reassembling_the_UI    The basic gist of it is that we may want to copy and fork the p2.ui.sdk.scheduler plugin rather than just include it. That includes the standard automatic updates check and popup. We can then make our version do both checks and present our own UI.    Another alternative is to write p2 repository related code to allow loading the SDK metadata/artifacts and NPM package metadata/artifacts and converting them into the p2 model. That would make the same check for update job check all of them, but we'd still need our own custom UI override (though we may then be able to add metadata to the CLI package.json to do dependency checking against Studio?).",8
TISTUD-5462,"The default user agents for Alloy and Node.ACS should refer to mobile platforms","The current default preferences for Alloy and Node.ACS project's user agent refers to the browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and IE.

TISTUD-5986,"Remove the blackberry device settings from preferences page","Steps to reproduce :    1) Configure the BlackBerry device settings such as Device IP, password and debug token in the preferences.  2) Launch an app on BlackBerry device - It prompts a dialog with the configured BlackBerry device settings and they are automatically saved to the launch configuration.  3) Change the password on the device, or get a new device with a different password - then it is more likely that user will update the preferences with the new device password.  4) Run the same app on BlackBerry device assuming that the new password is updated in the preferences.

TISTUD-6514,"Allow selecting the base repo and branch for a pull request","We allow generating Pull Requests from a forked repo. It currently assumes a lot and I'm bumping against the limitations now. It assumes that the current branch is the ""compare"" on the current repo. That seems fine to keep. The problem is that we can't change the base, which is hard-coded to be the parent repo (that the fork came off of) and that repo's default branch.    At the very least we should allow selecting the base branch. Ideally we'd also allow changing the base repo to any repo in the network of forks.",8
TISTUD-6541,"Studio Formatter behaves incorrectly causing JSHint errors","I have noticed that the formatter used within the Studio application has a number of issues that are causing me and my team a lot of difficulties when working with different tools and attempting to maintain a high level of code quality.    1. Studio reformats functions and var declarations within functions incorrectly. I say incorrect as it can cause JSHint errors afterwards also existing formatting applied, say by developer A, gets reformatted by Studio when developer B edits the documents.    Here is an example of a small function example that has been formatted with Sublime Text 2 and passes JSHint. It is also the style that I wish to use, which also is recommended in many books regarding code quality with JavaScript.    {code:title=FormattingCorrect.js|borderStyle=solid}  /**   * Test File for Appcelerator Studio Formatting Bug   *   * @author Ketan Majmudar   */    /**   * Example Function that maintains a space after the function parantheses and the braces.   * variable declaration within is indented for readibility and also allows for git merges   * to be easily reviewed. The   *   * ""use strict""; is used internally and is another issue when the Studio foramtter is used,   *  it throws errors when using JSLint and should respect certain code style guide conventions.   *   */    function exampleFunction() {      ""use strict"";      var myVar1,          myVar2,          myVar3;        switch (myVar1) {      case true:          myVar3 = true;          break;      case false:          myVar3 = false;          break;      default:          myVar3 = null;      }      Ti.API.log(myVar1 + myVar2 + myVar3);  }    exports.exampleFunction = exampleFunction;  {code}    If this is copy/pasted into Studio, and you use the Source Format option, by default or with custom settings, a few things happen that break the styling and flow.    The ""use strict""; statement is placed immediately to the right of the opening brace, the variables are all moved onto a single line, and switch statements re-indent themselves.    This is very frustrating when you are working on multiple branches of a project and the commits are going back and forth due to formatting changes made by the product. Take a look at what Studio does to the code example:    {code:title=FormattingBroken.js|borderStyle=solid}  /**   * Test File for Appcelerator Studio Formatting Bug   *   * @author Ketan Majmudar   */    /**   * Example Function that maintains a space after the function parantheses and the braces.   * variable declaration within is indented for readibility and also allows for git merges   * to be easily reviewed. The   *   * ""use strict""; is used internally and is another issue when the Studio foramtter is used,   *  it throws errors when using JSLint and should respect certain code style guide conventions.   *   */    function exampleFunction() {""use strict"";      var myVar1, myVar2, myVar3;        switch (myVar1) {          case true:              myVar3 = true;              break;          case false:              myVar3 = false;              break;          default:              myVar3 = null;      }      Ti.API.log(myVar1 + myVar2 + myVar3);  }    exports.exampleFunction = exampleFunction;  {code}    The case should be indented with the switch, the vars should stay on a newline and the ""use strict""; should not move.    This raises a wider question as why we can't use JSBeautifer rules/tags for certain settings. The formatting options and rules probably would better serve us if they adopted more of this standard approach that is more widely adopted. (just an idea).    My main issue is this current reformatting.    Key Issues that need to be addressed:  * ""use strict""; should not reflow immediately after the brace  * var declarations on newlines should not all be placed on a single line  * switch statements should not indent cases.",9

TISTUD-6833,"Android modules are not recognized as Java projects","h3. Summary  As of the release of Titanium (& Studio) 3.3.0, old Android modules project had to be recreated (the structure having changed, the new build scripts wouldn't build an project created previously).    However, new projects, even though they ""build"" through the script, are not proper Java projects anymore and can not be worked on via Titanium Studio. Even when imported in ADT they are pure ""text"" projects and no autocompletion or syntax validation is available anymore.    h3. How to reproduce  Having properly installed the following SDKS :   Android 4.4.2, Android 4.1.2, Android 2.3.3  And having the NDK installed and properly configured in studio.    From an empty workspace, when you create a new Android module (in the example named bob, with id com.bob), everything seems to work fine, no errors are displayed during the creation and you now get a structure where source files are in android/src/com/bob folder :    !AndroidModuleBug.png!    The Java files no longer appear as part of a *package*.  There are *no jar* dependencies shown.  It's not even a *proper Java project* anymore.    I have removed a "";"" in the screenshot to show that the *syntax validation* didn't pick it up.  When using *autocomplete*, you get the following message (cf. screenshot) ""This compilation unit is not on the build path of a Java project"".    When removing the fake syntax error, the module packages fine, however it can no longer be worked on properly : no proper Java editing, have to ""guess"" all the fields.    I have reinstalled Titanium Studio from scratch to make sure it was not related to a problem in the update mechanism.

I was unable to get rid of the update dialog to fix my SDK path setting (and some other bug around the sudo prompt was occurring, so I couldn't even install). In effect I had to restart and then quickly set my Titanium SDK path in preferences before the dialog popped up.    I think if there's a non-null Titanium SDK path in the user's prefs and it's not pointing at a valid SDK location, we may want to make the Titanium SDK install not be required.

TISTUD-6891,"Studio: Selecting vpc and then enabling services fails to manage keys correctly","h5. I have yet to determine if this is a regression. Updates to follow.    h5. Description:  I created a project without services enabled in a multi-vpc environment. I then selected a vpc using the studio drop-down. This presented an error as shown in the screenshot from 3:57:21. I then tried to enable services which failed with errors as shown in the screenshot from 3:57:56. Then trying to set a vpc failed with the error as shown in the screenshot from 3:58:07    h5. Steps to reproduce:  1) Create a new project in Studio (classic two-tab) with NO SERVICES enabled in a multi vpc environment.  2) Set the vpc pull-down to a vpc - note failure  3) Enable services - note failure  4) Set the vpc - note failures    h5. Result:  Many failures - assuming inability to use services.    h5. Expected Result:  Service enablement and key handling work as expected regardless of order performed.    NOTE: This does not occur if the vpc is NOT selected prior to enabling services.",5
TISTUD-6892,"Studio: Use CLI information for supported iOS options instead of items from Xcode-select version of Xcode","h5.

Make sure your CLI has the latest SDK selected: e.g. {{ti sdk select  3.4.0.v20140909222515}}  2. Make sure your CLI *only* recognize Xcode 5.1.1  3.

We’ve heard mention that we need specific versions like 6 or 7 installed by various parties before, but traditionally that was because of Android limitations.    There is instead likely a `ti info` bug like TISTUD-6909 but on the iOS side. Somehow the CLI is giving us different JSON values than we’ve traditionally received (i.e. Numbers where they used to be strings, objects where they used to be arrays). We couldn’t reproduce it locally for 6909, but were able to test and fix based on the user’s ti info output.    In this case, we are guessing we used to get an array and now get an object, but without the output we don’t know where. Please run:    {code}  titanium info -t ios -o json  {code}    So we can generate a test case for it, and fix it.",3

TISTUD-7682,"Update Windows SDK Preference Page to use Windows Publisher ID","We've had to make a change to some of the config/command line values we use for Windows SDK.    Basically before there was a Windows Phone Publisher GUID (-G) that was required. We ended up never actually using that, and it was a holdover from the Win 8 Mobile Web hybrid app stuff. Now that value and config value are optional, not required. It's used to specify the old Windows 8 publisher ID that MS assigned you, in the scenario that you're publishing an ""upgraded"" version of the app for Win 8.1/10.    There's now a ""sister"" config value/option called the WIndows Phone product id for the same upgraded 8->8.1 app scenario. It's to specify the old Win 8 app id. see https://github.com/sgtcoolguy/titanium_mobile_windows/blob/master/cli/commands/_build/config/wpProductId.js  Again that's optional. I think it's ok to not surface either of these two config/command line options because they'd be used extremely rarely by our customers. (plus one is more global - the Win 8 publisher GUID, while the other is app-specific - the Windows Phone product id).    The important change is likely to make the pref page handle showing/editing the new Windows publisher Id config value now (in place of the Windows Phone Publisher GUID we discussed above that it currently surfaces).

TISTUD-7981,"Use appc daemon to request system info","Appcelerator Studio will no longer need to call {{ti info -t <platform>}} a bunch of times each minute. With the appc daemon, Studio can simply connect to the server over a WebSocket and query the system information as well as listen for changes.    The appc daemon will ship with the appc cli, so Studio will not need to worry about installing the appc daemon. However, Studio will need to make sure appcd is running before trying to connect to it. If appcd is already running, the start operation immediately returns successfully.    Note: appcd isn't guaranteed to be globally installed. You will want to manually invoke it by calling {{node /path/to/appcd start}}.    This applies to all platforms: OS X, Linux, and Windows.    Studio will need to open a WebSocket to 127.0.0.1 port 1732. Once the socket is open, it will need to send a request using the appcd protocol. It's pretty simple. To kick off a request, Studio needs to send a stringified JSON object containing a {{version}}, {{path}}, {{id}}, and optionally a {{data}} payload.    Here's the JavaScript equivalent:    {code}  socket.send(JSON.stringify({      version: '1.0',      path: '/system-info',      id: '0'  });  {code}    The ""version"" must be {{1.0}}.    The ""path"" can be {{/system-info}} to get the info for ALL supported platforms (i.e. Android & iOS on OSX, Android & Windows on Windows, Android on Linux). The ""path"" may also contain the specific platform such as {{/system-info/ios}} or even platform specific info such as {{/system-info/ios/devices}}.    The ""id"" must be a string containing a unique request id. It can be a sequential number (cast as a string) or a UUID. The purpose of the ""id"" is that a single WebSocket can service multiple simultaneous requests and ""id"" is the only way you can match up the response with the initial request. For example, the appcd client generates a UUID for each request and then registers that UUID with an event emitter so that responses to the request ID are emitted to the code that made the request. Studio can use whatever mechanism it wishes to match responses with requests.    The ""data"" payload is optional. It's a JSON object containing additional information. It will allow Studio to specify additional request arguments and filtering options.    The response is a stringified JSON object containing an {{id}}, {{data}}, and possibly a {{status}}.    If the latest appc cli is not installed, and thus appc daemon is not installed, then Studio should continue to use the {{ti info}} method it does today.",8

TISTUD-8012,"Studio needs to call ""appc run"" / ""ti build"" to build iOS/Android modules","Titanium SDK add support for building Titanium native modules via the CLI a while ago. It is suspected that Studio is still calling {{ant}} for Android modules and {{python build.py}} for iOS modules. These need to be updated to use the CLI.    To build Android modules, simply run:    {code}  appc run --platform android --project-dir /path/to/module/android --build-only    - OR -    ti build --platform android --project-dir /path/to/module/android --build-only  {code}    For iOS modules, run:    {code}  appc run --platform ios --project-dir /path/to/module/iphone --build-only    - OR -    ti build --platform ios --project-dir /path/to/module/iphone --build-only  {code}    Things to note:  * There should be no notable difference between using the Appc CLI vs Titanium CLI, but I could be wrong. Please advise.  * The {{\-\-project\-dir}} must be to the module's platform-specific directory.  * {{\-\-build\-only}} is only supported by iOS module build. Android support is coming in Titanium SDK 5.3.0 (TIMOB-20510).  * The {{build.py}} has been officially deprecated as of Titanium SDK 5.2.1 and will be removed from new module projects in Titanium SDK 6.0.0, possibly 5.3.0 or 5.4.0.  * Refer to TIDOC-2470 for more details.",5

TISTUD-8491,"Android:Reconnect to the debug session after the app is restarted","If a user attempts to debug a mobile app, then app initiates a debug connections during its startup. As Studio receives the debug connection request, it initiates the socket connection and receives the debug data. However, if the app is accidentally crashed/terminated on device or simulator, then the user has to re-launch the debug session (which will re-build the app and deploy onto device again).     If the app is restarted on the device (or simulator), then it attempts to make a debug connection to Studio, but Studio is no more listening to the debug connection requests. Studio should listen to the debug connection request even though the app is terminated/crashed, so that the user does not need to re-launch debugging the app again.",8
