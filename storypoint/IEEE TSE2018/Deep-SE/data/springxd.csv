XD-100,"Rename Tuple class in spring-xd-tuple","The Tuple classes in Reactor follow the more traditional data structure concept of Tuples, an immutable fixed length sequence of values where each value can have different types.  They are ordered and can often be access by index.    An example in a static language is the Tuple class found in .NET http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.tuple.aspx or in Scala http://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/scala_tuples.htm    Using this standard definition of a Tuple, they do not support named values.  There is also a different tuple class instance for each length, e.g. Tuple<T1,T2>, Tuple<T1,T2,T3>.    The Tuple class in XD is more like a record or named tuple.     Python has a named tuple concept - http://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple    and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1490413/languages-that-allow-named-tuples shows that other languages use the term 'Record' for a 'named tuple' - Haskell, Standard ML, OCaml, and F#.    http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/F_Sharp_Programming/Tuples_and_Records#Defining_Records    So boiling it all down, to avoid conflicts of names, and also to open up the possibility of using Reactor tuples as keys (instead of strings for names), we should change the name to either NamedTuple or Record.  ATM, there is no direct relationship between Reactor's Tuple and NamedTuple (such as inheritance) and so probably Record is the way to go.      ",2

Currently the only channels used are the .NNN numeric channels where NNN is the index of the module in the stream definition. The source/sink channels are 'extra' channels that need creating - the source channel acting as a real source for the next module in the chain whilst the sink channel acts as a sink output for the last channel in the chain.      I can think of two ways to handle the implementation:  - In order to police the stream structure as ""source | processor* | sink"" maybe special SourceChannel and SinkChannel modules are created to represent these channels and when deployment happens the deployer understands that they don't represent a real request to deploy a module but simply the channels to wire up to the adjacent module.    - Carry source/sink channel info in the existing module definitions. But then the verification of source/processor*/sink structure will need modification to say a source isn't necessary if the first processor has a source channel attached and a sink isn't necessary if the last processor has a sink channel attached.

XD-701,"Refactor Message conversion in ChannelRegistrySupport","After an initial attempt which was not ready for M2 we are rethinking our strategy. One of the fundamental things we have come to realize is that its important to treat serialization and type conversion as separate concerns.  Serialization:  A core principle is the consumer should by default receive exactly what the producer sent:    -   If the producer sends a byte[] payload then no serialization is required.      -   A String payload can use simple byte conversion, taking the Charset into account    -  Transporting an Object uses whatever serialization is configured (json, xml, avro, protocol buffer, java.io, msgpack, etc.).   The actual serialization performed for each message must be shared with the producer and consumer. I.e., the consumer needs to know which case above applies to each payload. Currently we are using the MessageHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE defining custom mime types for this (The designated header is subject to change)  Conversion:     - The consumer optionally defines one or more content-types (read MimeType) it can accept in order of preference. If no conversion succeeds, we can either give them the byte[] payload or throw an exception (configurable?).  Examples:  - Consumer accepts a Java Object (application/x-java-object;type=example.Foo).  Assume for simplicity, the consumer may send a JSON String, or a Foo.  On the receiving end we need to distinguish a String payload containing a JSON representation of Foo from a serialized Foo payload. If the payload is a String, we need to know that its original content is application/json. We are currently using a 2nd ""original-content-type"" message header to supply this information.  So in the first case we have (conceptually) content-type: ""XD plain text"" , original-content-type ""application/json"".  In the second case we have content-type: ""XD Serialized JSON"" original-content-type not used in this case since the serialized JSON includes type information (using Jackson conventions which are a bit brittle).   -If the producer type is different from the accepted type, we use the conversion service and the consumer must register appropriate converters.   A twist for XD that may be generally relevant is that some optimization is possible when we know the bytes represent JSON:  -  Tuple conversion:  Since we serialize using JSON and we know how to transform JSON <->Tuple,  we can convert any Object  payload or any JSON String to a Tuple.  We can avoid the two step deserialization+conversion,  e.g.   1) Foo->JSON->Foo 2) Foo->Tuple. ",10

XD-703,"JobRepository should be persistent and shared across xd-admin/xd-container","The current code is creating an in-memory job repository for each batch job that is launched.  This makes it impossible to query the tables in the job repository across the cluster.  A single job repository that is backed by a file need to be shared across all jobs that are a launched.    *Implementation Suggestions*  * The XDAdmin server should create the job repository schema, if not found, in a HSQLDB database, when it starts up  * The bean definitions should be added to the same context that the analytics are being loaded in as it is already shared across xd-admin/xd-container.  The ‘analytics’ context should be renamed to something more generic, ‘shared parent context’ or something.  * There is some clean up (removal) of the code in the current JobPlugin, META-INF/spring-xd/plugins/job/common.xml wouldn’t be needed anymore.  That might be all, not sure.    *How to verify it works*  * A JUnit test that verifies the spring batch tables were created in the job repository when xd-admin is launched.  This would require deleting the backing db file before instantiating singlenode/xd-admin/xd-container.    * If you start the xd-container it should be able to find the necessary DataSource/JobRepository beans information to be able to contact the database.

XD-705,"A batch job can be launched by sending a message on a channel","*Description*  When a job is ‘created’ in SpringXD, a ‘control-channel’ for that job is also created.  The listener for that channel will receive a message, be able to take the ‘jobParameters’ and other launch information from the message, and be able to launch/run the job.    NOTE: I can see a few other stories that should probably be made to break this up after writing it. I put estimate of 10 for now, but we should break this up.  Here are some suggestions    1. create ‘data only’ JobParametersBean equivalent with primitive types  2. create jobLauncher source  3. create jobParameterTransformer processor  4. Refactoring of ChannelRegistry’s aliasHing to use a callback strategy.      *Implementation Suggestions*    job create --name helloWorldJob --definition ""myjob --somePropertyToOverride=someValue    * This would not execute the batch job immediately, but instead register the job definition and deploys a “jobLauncher�? and the job definition to an XD-Container.    * The XD-Container that receives the deploy request message will create a module application context, will also create a channel with the Channel registry named after the job, e.g. :myJob.  This should be a pub/sub channel from the point of view of the middleware.  From the point of view of the spring integration channel, it should ideally be of the executor channel.  There is a limitation in the current implementation of ChannelRegistry now as ‘createInbound’ only creates direct channels.  The boolean ‘aliasHint’ should probably be extended to some type of callback that creates a channel.  The aliasHint was added to address the case of LocalChannelRegistry creating or looking up a queue backed channel or a direct channel.  There will be a consumer on the SI channel in the module application context that will be responsible for getting the job launch information and launching the job.  The launching of the job may need to be explicitly done in a separate thread if direct channels are created by the ChannelRegistry.  The contents of the message should be something similar to the current “JobParametersBean�?, it needs to be easily serializable with simple types via JSON over the wire.  The current impl of “JobParametersBean�? has ObjectMapper, so that may require a bit of reworking.  The handler of the message will use the jobLauncher to launch the job, using the information in the JobParametersBean.    * The ‘myjob’ can then be launched by sending a message, perhaps this is handled by having a jobLauncher source    jobLauncher [--jobParameters <jobParameters>] [--dateFormat <dateFormat>] [--numberFormat <numberFormat>] [--makeUnique <makeUnique>]  > :myJob    e.g. with no-args    jobLauncher  > :myJob    *How to verify it works*    With the test HelloSpringXDTasklet, we should be able to create the job    job create --name helloSpringXD --definition ""myjob""    This will not launch the job (as mentioned in the ‘implementation’ section.    It would then be launched by     jobLauncher  > :myJob    where jobLauncher is a new source.    Ideally would like to be able to test a data driven triggering.  This would require a new file source that doesn’t use the file-to-string-transformer, but lets a File object be the payload.    file | jobParameterTransformer > :myJob  ",16
XD-707,"Support use of separate control and message transports","Control transport - Deploy/Undeploy requests  Message transport - Inter module communication    Currently complicated because starting a Job for example currently uses message transport vs control transport.

XD-718,"Use ParentLastClassLoader to create the Modules ApplicationContext.","The ParentLastClassloader is located in the spring-hadoop project.  It will resolve classes first looking at the child context and then the parent.  This works well for XD since the we want and dependencies of the module to be considered first and if not found, resolve against the parent. It would be possible to even include other versions of .jars already in the parent classloaders (e.g. Spring Integration jars), but for now, we will not immediately test that case.    SimpleModule needs to change to that we can pass in the classloader to use for creating the application context. The current implementation creates a GenericApplicationContext as a field initializer...that should change to be in the ctor.    ModuleDeployer should implement .BeanClassLoaderAware.  The classloader passed in to the BeanClassLoaderAware callback will be used as the ‘parent’ when creating the ParentLastClassloader.      The URL[] to pass into ParentLastClassloader should be ‘null’ or an empty array in this case of an older style module.  (Hopefully ParentLastClassloader  allows that type of fallback).    *Implementation Suggestions:*  The ModuleDeployer code is where the application context for the module is defined and instantiated.   Here is a possible impl path.    1. Assuming we can always use ParentLastClassloader (even for older style modules), then the ModuleDescriptor needs to return an array of URL[] locations for the module, getURL().  This is passed into the cto for SimpleModule.  The ctor then creates a new application context, creates the parentclassloader, sets the classloader on the application context and then proceeds as normal.   2.AbstractModuleRegistry should try and load the resource from two possible locations, e.g.     ./modules/source/file/config/file.xml    or    ./modules/source/file.xml    The module registry needs to be a bit smarter to know, ah, i see a config directory, let me try ./config/file.xml otherwise just ./file.xml      *How to verify it works.*    1. JUnit test in which one of the ModuleRegistry implementations points to a test directory that contains both old and new style modules.  FileModuleRegistry is probably a good choice here.  Need to test that the new getting for URL[] works as expected.    2. Existing tests should run as they did before, in particular the shell integration tests.",5

XD-742,"REST API for Job Management","Spring Batch Admin provides a complete, but outdated implementation style, which covers the full administrative lifecycle of batch jobs, their creation, stop/start, and retrieving information about previous job executions and the status of currently executing job executions.  SpringXD has a different way of deploying, starting, and stopping jobs - by sending messages to containers that run the batch job.  However, the reporting state of a job is still stored in a common job repository.  The purpose of this story is to take the first step to merging in the existing code base that focuses only on the retrieval of information from Spring Batch Admin’s Job controller.  The current ‘REST API’ style of these commands should stay as close to the original spring batch admin style as possible.  There are several reasons for this 1. It works, and time to springone is short, and we mgmt has expectations around deliverables that we must strive to meet. 2. It gives Andrew a working contract to start developing a UI 3. We can take on this technical debt, but refactor after RC1 and before GA while and deliver end-user functionality.    Attached is the list of endpoints in spring batch admin ",20
XD-743,"Ensure that when batch jobs are created, they are created with the job bean definition id equal to the ‘stream name’","Unlike in spring-batch-admin, in SpringXD all the jobs the /modules/jobs directory is not ‘visible’ to query when the server starts.  Jobs only become visible to XD’s ‘jobs list’ command once they have been ‘created’.      Creating a Job in XD is an opportunity to specify additional values to any property placeholders in the job bean definition.  This isn’t part of spring-batch-admin.    We will not worry about the creation of job definition in this story.  Assume that they have been created already and that the GET for /jobs works as it does now for Spring XD.     We should however, make sure that there is always a replacement of the job name in the job bean definition to match the ‘--name’ specified in the command line.  That is “job create --name myjob --description “thisfunkyjob�?    will use ‘myjob to replace <job id=""${xd.stream.name}"" in the file thisfunkyjob.xml    *Implementation Suggestions*    This should hopefully just be a matter of changing job definition files to follow the naming pattern.    <job id=""${xd.stream.name}"" … />    *How to verify it works*    1. Create a JUnit integration style test that has ‘job create --name myjob --defintion “testJob�?’ and then deploy the job.  The name ‘myjob’ should appear in the job execution table  ",1

XD-745,"Return the list of Jobs from spring-batch-admin","The current XD JobController that returns a list of jobs has quite a different API signature than what is in spring-batch-admin.  To simplify the UI development, a new controller JobAdminController, will be created that lives under the request path /jobs/admin.  The goal is to return a the current JSON structure of spring-batch-admin /jobs/ request and make only minimal changes to implementations of controllers as found .  See #1 in the Doc (link to json output doc for spring batch).    *Implementation Suggestions*    There will need to be some SpringMVC setup that will enable the current style of spring-batch-admin controller requests to co-exist with the existing XD Controllers, e.g. the use of .json for json marshalling etc.  This may in fact be the bulk of time spend in this first story to integration spring-batch-admin style controllers into XD.

XD-756,"Create a splitter module","The splitter functionality in Spring Integration should be exposed to XD as a processing module.  The splitter should use a SpEL expression to specify how to split the message up.      *Implementation Suggestions*    This should be a simple XML based module definition that has input/output channels and has the SpEL expression parameterized.  The default value of the SpEL expression should result in the message not being split.    *How to check it works*    The current file or tail input source can be used to split up the text in a file into words.  The tail module should be checked to see how many lines of text it will read into memory at once.  The file module node with the file-to-string transformer will only work for small files as it keep the whole file in memory.      If there is a big memory inefficiency in using the tail file input source, create a new story to investigate how to have a file based input source that creates a message per line of text or something that is will not result in excessive memory usage.

The completion criteria for the aggregator should be a simple count of messages (e.g. received 50 messages) and a timeout so that messages don't stay in the aggregator module for more than 30 seconds.     *Implementation suggestions*    Create an XML based processing module definition using the SI aggregator namespace.  Only the options to support the features in the description should be exposed as property placeholders.    *How to know it works*  A shell style integration test that has a source that sends a known amount of messages.  A ticktock like module would perhaps be a good example.  10 messages sent every 100ms with an aggregator set to a 'aggregate count' of 10, should have 1 message output (perhaps to file sink whose name is based on time as well, is that possible.).  A ticktock example with a 1 second delay and with the aggregator module set to have a timeout of 0.5 seconds will have only one message in the file (again assumign the file name has a timestamp/counter in the filename).

This should be change to use the attribute routing-key-expression so that the routing-key can be determined using SpEL.  This will enable a dynamic evaluation of the routing-key based on message payload/header.    *Implementation Suggestions*    This hopefully should be changing the XML description of the sink to 		    routing-key-expression=""${routingKey:'${xd.stream.name}'}    This way, the ${xd.stream.name} is surrounded by a single quote to indicate a string literal to SpEL in the default case.      *How to verify it works.*    One of the simple uses of this is to create a routing key based on payload.  In a distributed word-count example, the hashcode of a word would be sent to a certain number of processing modules that would perform the count. The idea is that the same word is sent to the same node over and over again, in particular if in-memory counters or state is computed - using centralized redis counters this wouldn't be necessary in the case of only counter state.    The stream     http | rabbit --routingKey=""'word-' + payload.hashCode() % 3""    is an example of a stream that can be used to verify that messages published to a direct exchange will have routing keys of the value word-0, word-1, and word-2.  Binding a queue to each of these routing keys, one can observe the contents of messages in the queue to make sure that words are being routed to the appropriate queue, e.g. publishing ""hello"" as the payload of an http request should always appear in the same queue.  The rabbitmq admin console can be used for this purpose.  ",3

XD-841,"Create a packaging model for custom modules","Like just discussed after the Spring One session, it would be nice to have a packaging model for custom modules. Instead of putting all libs in one directory and an XML in another, it could be a fat jar including some metadata file pointing to either an XML or to a JavaConfig configuration class inside the jar. Some more words why I think it's important to have something like that: Spring XD can be very well used in the enterprise, and at least for job modules it's likely to have some dependencies. So what do you have to do now to deploy such a module? Build a jar with your build process, then get it from your repository, unpack it and somehow find the relevant XML to copy it into the appropriate folder, then inspect the POM to find out what all the dependencies are, direct and transient, and get them from your repository to copy them into the appropriate folder. And of course, copy the jar. And when using Spring XD in distributed mode, you have to do it several times. With the approach mentioned above you just build your fat jar with your build process and distribute it to all your nodes, nothing complicated.  And if you implement it like that it's easy to have a JavaConfig support that's almost the same.",9

This is important for Batch Jobs as they need to access the file itself for the reader.   We need to *keep in mind the various transports we support*. Not sure how Kryo handles file serialization.

XD-953,"Richer module options metadata","Module options are currently implemented using PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer, doing simple ""text"" replacements.    This story proposes to introduce a richer model for module options, which could take the following xml representation (keeping in mind that there would be an underlying set of classes that could also apply to e.g. @Configuration approach):    {code:xml}  <xd:params>    <xd:param name=""port"" help=""the http port to listen on"" />  </xd:params>  {code}    So, the very first obvious benefit is providing help metadata.  The second one is an easy way to list available option names, without resorting to brittle PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer hacks (we wouldn't for example detect xd.stream.name or XD_TRANSPORT as a valid option)    One could also specify defaults/computations, this time benefiting from SpEL everywhere:  {code:xml}  <xd:params>    <xd:param name=""directory"" default=""headers.directory"" />  </xd:params>  {code}    Lastly, this opens the door to better type checking / combinations / optionality support:  {code:xml}  <xd:params valid=""fixedDelay || cron"">    <xd:param name=""fixedDelay"" type=""int"" />    <xd:param name=""cron"" type=""string"" />  </xd:params>  {code}    The 'valid' attribute can e.g. be evaluated by SpEL.    Some final remarks:  - That construct can be compatible with our current approach by behaving as a PropertySource itself (instead of creating a PropertySource, the StreamPlugin would give this new bean the java.util.Properties)  - Plugins could benefit from a hook in that construct and advertise the fact that they expect/provide new options (e.g. --inputType)    There is a slight problem though, which is that if this construct lives in the same AppContext as the module definition itself, then the AppContext needs to be refreshed for the logic to kick in. One could circumvent that using profiles, or we could rely on a different filename convention (e.g. <module>-params.xml)      ",10

However the data may already have a timestamp in it (eg streams from activity events on a website).   It would be useful as an alternative approach to be able to specify this field to aggregate on.     This would have the following benefits:    1) The aggregate counts would be more accurate as they would reflect the acutal event times and not have any lag from an intermediate messgaging system they might have passed through.  2) If for whatever reason XD is down, comes back up and starts pulling queued messages from the messaging system the aggregate counter will reflect the correct event time. Currently you would get a gap and then a spike as a backlog of messages would get allocated to the current aggregate count.  3) Old data could be rerun through XD still creating the correct aggregate counts.    Configuration would be something like     stream create --name mytap --definition ""tap:mystream > aggregatecounter --name=mycount --timestampField=eventtime""    without the timestampfield it would behave as currently. ",5
XD-1048,"Extend aggregate counter to dynamically aggregate by field values in addition to time.","This would be a combination of the existing aggregate counter and field value counter functionality.  For example if the stream data was for car purchases some fields might be colour, make and model.  When analysing the aggregate data I dont just want to know how many were sold on Monday, but how many of each make or how many of each colour,  or how many of a particular colour, make AND model. This would allow a dashboard type client to 'drill down' into each dimension or combination of dimensions (in real time without executing batch queries against the raw data)  Ideally the aggregate counter would be specified as   stream create --name mytap --definition ""tap:mystream > aggregatecounter --name=mycount --fieldNames=colour,make,model""  The keys would be dynamically created according to the field values in each record (ie in a similar way to the field value counter you would not need to predefine field values) and keys would be created for all combinations of the fields specified eg the record   { ""colour"":""silver"" , ""make"":""VW"" , ""model"" : ""Golf"" }   would increment the following key counters (in addtion to the existing time buckets)  <existing base counter - ie all fields for this time bucket> colour:black make:VW model:Golf colour:black.make:VW colour:black.model:Golf make:VW.model:Golf colour:black.make:VW.model:Golf  ie the actual keys would look something like  aggregatecounters.mycount.make:VW.model:Golf.201307 etc  This may seem like it would generate a lot of key combinations but in practice the data generated will still be massively less than the raw data, and keys will only be created if that combination occurs in a time period.  Also some fields may be dependent on each other (such as make and model in the above example) so the amount of possibilites for those composite keys would be a lot less that the number of one times the number of the other.

Create a job definition from a job module by providing a name and properties that apply to all job instances can be configured at this point.  The job is not yet deployed  3. Deploy the job to an xd-container.  A job instance can not be created by sending a message to a job queue that contains optional runtime job parameters  4. Launch a job by sending a message to the job queue with job parametres.  A Job Instance is created, representing a specific run of the job.  A Job Instance is the Job Definition plus the runtime job parameters.  You can query for the Job Instances associated with a given job name  5. The job is executed creating a Job Exection object that captures the success or failure of the job.  You can query for the Job Executions associated with a given job name.  6. Undeploy a job.

XD-1296,"Few integration tests fail if JMX is enabled","If JMX is enabled, some of the integration tests fail.    This is similar to what we see in XD-1295.    One example of this case is, the test classes that extend StreamTestSupport.    In StreamTestSupport, the @BeforeClass has this line:    moduleDeployer = containerContext.getBean(ModuleDeployer.class);    When JMX is enable, the IntegrationMBeanExporter creates JdkDynamicProxy for the ModuleDeployer (since it is of type MessageHandler) and thereby the above line to get bean by the implementing class type (ModuleDeployer) fails.    There are few other places where we use to refer the implementing classes on getBean().  Looks like we need to fix those as well.    ",2

XD-1319,"Allow mixins of ModuleOptionsMetadata","A lot of modules have similar options. Moreover, job modules often have options that belong to at least two domains (eg jdbc + hdfs).  I think that by using FlattenedCompositeModuleOptionsMetadata, we could come up with a way to combine several options POJOs into one. Something like:  public class JdbcHdfsOptionsMetadata {    @OptionsMixin   private JdbcOptionsMetadata jdbc;    @OptionsMixin   private HdfsOptionsMetadata hdfs; }  this would expose eg ""driverClass"" as well as ""rolloverSize"" as top level options. Values could be actually injected into the fields, so that eg custom validation could occur (default validation for the mixin class would occur by default)",5
XD-1321,"Add XD deployment for YARN","Add YARN specific code based on Janne's prototyping    Add YARN Client and AppMaster implementations and startup config files    This includes shell scripts to deploy XD to YARN    Test working on Apache 2.2 distribution    We can modify config files, everything should be possible to override by providing command-line args or env variables.  ./xd-yarn-deploy --zipFile /tmp/spring-xd-yarn.zip --config /tmp/spring-xd-yarn.yml    ",8
XD-1322,"Add way to provide module config options for XD on YARN","There seems to be some intersection with the work for this issue and the rationalization of how module properties are handled.  There will be changes to configuration/property management support such that each module (source, sink, etc) will be able to also be overridden in spring-xd.yml (or wherever -Dspring.config.location points to.  The HDFS sink module for example, will have default values based on it's OptionsMetadata and will be of the form <type>.<module>.<option>      That means in the configuration for hdfs.xml sink, there would be a config section such as    {code:xml}      <configuration>        fs.default.name=${sink.hdfs.hd.fs}        mapred.job.tracker=${sink.hdfs.hd.jt}        yarn.resourcemanager.address=${sink.hdfs.hd.rm}        mapreduce.framework.name=${sink.hdfs.mr.fw}      </configuration>  {code}    With default values defined by a HdfsSinkOptionsMetadata class.  The hdfs.xml module file would not contain any references to a properties file.    A file specified by -Dspring.config.location could override the values in a config section such as    sink:    hdfs:      hd.fs : hdfs://foobarhost:8020      hd.jt : 10.123.123.123:9000    etc.    ",5

Here is another example where GemFire was used as the messaging system:   https://github.com/charliemblack/spring-xd/blob/master/spring-xd-dirt/src/main/java/org/springframework/xd/dirt/server/options/CommonDistributedOptions.java#L38  All messaging enums should be removed for an extensible model.",1
XD-1337,"Stream partitioning metadata should allow updating at runtime - dynamically / anytime","In a running system some times the algorithm for partitioning the data might overload a given server with work.  When that happens we might need to ""rebalance"" the partitioned work / data to achieve a even balance of stream throughput across servers in a given compute group.  We can think of this dynamic rebalancing behavior as an extension of a failure use case.   In the failure scenario we need to re-partition the stream to other servers in the group.  We should allow third parties to plug-in to help with this capability.  As an example GemFire will report the new partitioning meta-data when this type failure / rebalance happens. ",8

This was done so downstream stream operations could work on the data with out suffering any network IO.

Because the container(2) that processes ""job launch"" request deploys the job again, it conflicts with an existing job that is deployed in conatiner(1) with the same name in the JobRepository.

If we have an output channel for the job module, we get the following benefits:    1) The output channel reflects the JobExecution from the job launching message handler's reply channel  2) This can be different from JobExecution listener's notification channel where we would get both the beforeJob() and afterJob() notification.  3) We can tap the output channel to send the job results to some other sinks.

XD-1393,"Support explicit client connect string for ZooKeeper","This will have an effect on both singlenode and distributed mode as   described below...    *singlenode:*    Currently, when running in singlenode mode, an embedded ZooKeeper server is started, and it discovers an available port for client connections and exposes it via a getClientPort() method.    With this change, IF a client connect string is provided explicitly, the embedded ZooKeeper server should not be started, but instead the client connection should be established using that explicitly provided connect string. SEE the ""todo"" comment above the `SpringApplicationBuilder admin` line within `SingleNodeApplication`.    *distributed:*    Currently, when running in distributed mode, the client connect string is hardcoded to `localhost:2181`. Obviously that is only a short term solution since a real-world distributed runtime would span multiple machines (including the ZooKeeper ensemble itself). That is also why the connect string must support a comma-delimited list of `host:port` values (for redundancy), but the constructor for `ZooKeeperConnection` that accepts a client connect string already supports that via the underlying `CuratorFramework` builder.    With this change, a command-line argument for the client connect string will be passed into the `ZooKeeperConnection` constructor, within the configuration (e.g. SEE the ""todo"" statement within `ContainerServerApplication.DistributedZooKeeperConnectionConfiguration`).",4

This broke eg ModuleCommandTests.testComposedModulesValuesInDefinition because basically composed module options activate no profile.  The problem is that there is no real way to know what to activate currently, because when deploying a part of a composed module, its metadata is actually a link to the *whole* metadata, but does not really know which part.  Long story short, something we may be able to do is to activate the union of all profiles, but this breaks very easily : module compose foo --definition ""transform --expr=foo | transform --script=bar""  would try to activate both ""script"" and ""expression"" profiles for both modules.",5

Here is the scenario for a stream ""http | transform | log"", with XD_MODULE_CONFIG_LOCATION and XD_MODULE_CONFIG_NAME using their default values.   In, ${xd.config.home}/modules/modules.yml, I have:  processor:    transform:      expression: ""'Inside modules.yml'""    and, in, ${xd.config.home}/modules/processor/transform/transform.properties, I have:  expression: ""'First module: inside transform.properties'""    Now, I deploy this stream: ""http | transform | log"".    Lets say, I have another stream that uses the transform module, but this time I want to change the expression in ${xd.config.home}/modules/processor/transform/transform.properties to,  expression: ""'Second module'""    Now, when the stream containing this transform module gets deployed, it uses the same transform.properties that is used by the previously deployed transform module.    What I understand from this behavior is that, the EnvironmentAwareModuleOptionsMetadataResolver caches the module environments for a given module type and name. When the same module is deployed from a given stream again, it uses the stored module environment and doesn't refresh/load the property sources from the module config locations mentioned above. Though this is good in one way that same module environment is re-used, changing the externalized module config properties would have no affect after the first module of same type/name is deployed.    Though the EnvironmentAwareModuleOptionsMetadataResolver is used by both admin and container, this JIRA focuses more on the container side.  There is one valid point with the current behavior where the module environment is cached and won't change. But is this by design?",4

This can be avoided by quoting the classname. However, a further complication is if the array element is an object. In this case the classname is '[L<classname>;'. The trailing colon causes a parse exception even in a quoted string.  A simple fix is to check for the trailing colon, remove it and add it back if MimeType.getParameter(""type"").contains(""[L"").

XD-1972,"Add ability to define nested jobs","h3.  Narrative  As a developer, I need to be able to create a Spring XD job module that consists of a job orchestrating the execution of other Spring Batch jobs using the Spring Batch Job Step (see section 5.3.6 here: http://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/reference/html/configureStep.html) within the same module definition.    h3.  Acceptance Criteria  # Define the ""contract"" for a job module  ## Currently the contract consists of a single job definition within the assembled {{ApplicationContext}} ({{context.getBean(Job.class)}}).  ## The new version will need to document what job definition within the assembled {{ApplicationContext}} should be run as the entry point.  I'm assuming it would be by id ({{context.getBean(""job"")}} for example) of the job but am open to other options.  # A custom job module that orchestrates multiple Spring Batch jobs via Job steps should be able to be deployed and executed as a single Spring XD module.  ## Spring XD launches the job that conforms to the previously defined ""contract"".  ## Spring Batch manages the execution of the child jobs.  # The existing OOTB jobs should work under the new ""contract"".    h3.  Assumptions  # The UI should ""just work"" in that child jobs update the job repository independently so no updates should be needed for an MVP of this functionality.  # *This will be a breaking change for users that have developed custom job modules.*    h3.  Out of Scope  # Execution of child jobs that are remote (deployed on another node / {{ApplicationContext}}).  # Dynamically assembling jobs via the shell's DSL or the UI.  ",3

XD-2232,"Add support for estimating the median value of a data stream.","Often it is useful to have access to the median value for fields of a data stream since they are more robust with respect to outliers.  The median is defined as the value of a dataset such that, when sorted, 50% of the data is smaller than the value and 50% of the data is larger then the value. Ordinarily this is difficult to calculate on a stream because it requires the collection and sorting of all data.  The median of a data stream can be approximated with a technique called stochastic averaging. To approximate the median value of a data stream one could use the following approach: Given the current estimate of the median {{M}}. If the next observed value in the stream is larger than {{M}}, increase the current estimate by {{r}} (= the learning rate). If it is smaller, decrease the estimate by {{r}}. When {{M}} is close to the median, it increases as often as it decreases, and therefore it stabilizes.   The following example shows a primitive implementation of the above mentioned algorithm in groovy (to be placed under ${XD_HOME}/modules/processor/scripts). {code:groovy} import org.springframework.xd.tuple.TupleBuilder; import org.springframework.xd.tuple.Tuple;  /**  * Stochastic averaging to compute the median of a data stream.  * To approximate this value using stochastic optimization, the value  * of interest is the current estimate of the median M. If the next observed   * value of the stream is larger than M, increase by r. If it is smaller decrease the  * estimate by r. When M is close to the median, it increases as often as it decreases,  * and therefore stablilizes.  * r denotes the learningRate.  */ enum MedianEstimator{      INSTANCE    //TODO Add support for estimating multiple medians   /*    * The current median value.    */   double current = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY      public double update(double value, double learningRate){          //Initialize current with given value     if(current == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY){        current = value     }          if(current == value){       return current     }      //Move current value towards the median     current = current + (current < value ? learningRate : -learningRate)      return current   } }  //TODO Make learning rate configurable def learningRate = 0.7 //TODO Add support for dynamic field selection. double median = MedianEstimator.INSTANCE.update(payload.getDouble('value'), learningRate)  def fieldNames = new ArrayList<String>(payload.getFieldNames()) def fieldValues = new ArrayList<Object>(payload.getValues())  //TODO Add make median output field configurable fieldNames.add(""value_median"") fieldValues.add(median)  //Return the original tuple values extended with the computed median.

After ~15 the median value should stabilize.

XD-2233,"REST representation of an aggregate-counter can lead to mixed up output","The current representation of REST resources of time-series data (e.g. aggregate counter) can lead to problems in consuming applications.  Despite the time series data provided by the ""counts"" data structure is logically ordered by key (timestamps) it doesn't guarantee an ordering, since many consuming applications interpret JSON data as an unordered map like data structure.  Because of this consuming applications have to apply special ordering / transformation logic to get the data in an chronologically ordered fashion. It would be helpful if one could configure the rendering of the time series data, e.g. as a list of json object like: {code:json} {  ""ts"":""Sun Oct 12 23:10:23 CEST 2014""  ,""value"": 42 }  {code} Where {{ts}} denotes the timestamp and {{value}} denotes the value. It would also be helpful if one could adjust the date format either with a pattern or a well known date format like, c.f.  {{ISO 8601}}.  I attached a python example for this that demonstrates the problem.

See sqoop documentation [here|http://sqoop.apache.org/docs/1.4.5/SqoopUserGuide.html#_incremental_imports]. The job will need to maintain some state between executions in order to decide the start point for the next data load.     The jdbchdfs job definition could take the following 2 new options.     h5. checkColumn   optional  Specifies the column to be examined when determining which rows to import. (the column should not be of type CHAR/NCHAR/VARCHAR/VARNCHAR/ LONGVARCHAR/LONGNVARCHAR). Column should be numeric or timestamp.  h5. lastValue   optional  If specified this will override any data saved from previous job runs. If not specified will take the saved max-value from the last job run. If no last job run data is available then it will not be an incremental load and all the data which satisfies the query will be used.    Sqoop provides 2 modes of operation for incremental load, 'append' and 'lastModified'. For jdbchdfs the job will always append as it is writing to a hdfs file.    Example: To import data from the database table some_table which has a last update column called lastUpdated, you could use.  {code}  xd:> job create myjob --definition ""jdbchdfs --sql='select col1,col2,col3 from some_table' --checkColumn=lastUpdated"" --deploy  {code}    The batch job should also be capable of being partitioned to run in parallel across multiple containers",5

XD-2469,"Parent Modules","Thinking about the UBS(?) scenario that MP described. They want all their Cassandra modules to share a connection, leading to the need for a parent context for those modules. We could introduce a parent module for this purpose. The module declares a parent in its properties which likely ends up as a parent module definition in the module definition. When the child module is deployed, its parent must be deployed first if it is not already (i.e., parent is a singleton per container). The module sets that as it's parent context.  We would have to make sure things happen in the correct order so the global context is the parent of the parent (ad infinitum). The alternative is to add a module parent context to the XD hierarchy which is extensible, but this is more elegant IMHO.  Also, in cases that don't require singleton bean definitions, the parent could package and provide common jars to children, e.g., we set the parent module's classloader as the parent classloader, eliminating the need to install common jars in an HDFS path (basically the approach I described https://jira.spring.io/browse/XD-2420)   MP : >> Also, in cases that don't require singleton bean definitions, the parent could package and provide common jars to children, e.g., we set the parent module's classloader as the parent classloader This approach does not offer some of the advantages offered by a central yaml config noted in the JIRA . But it is simpler in many ways. The developer just installs a parent module containing dependent jars and sets that as a parent in the child modules. This requires no additional infrastructure. To address the hadoop scenario we discussed, we would need another level of indirection so the parent of the hdfs modules is bound to the configured hadoop distro.   e.g. something like  parent = ${xd.hadoop.distro} in module properties  MF: Possibly the parent modules could go in the ""common"" directory? They should be considered ""abstract"" also - in the same sense as abstract bean definitions in a Spring context (and they should only be started on demand when needed by at least one concrete child module - then destroyed when the last child module is destroyed).  Maybe this would also allow us to wrap up those xml files that currently live in ""common"" so that they are treated as parent modules?  MF: Yea, that sounds good wrt to common.  Also it might be a good idea to enable spring to throw an error if it finds more than one bean of the same name in the application context - i think that applies to searching in parent contexts as well.  this would avoid the 'last one wins' rule and give more deterministic behavior.

The Version of SpringXD we planned on using is 1.1    However we need HA and we need to connect to a cluster with multiple locators. Problem is this isn’t supported yet in SpringXD.    We have used multiple locators in many projects in EMC and we don’t want to revert back to a situation where we have to put virtual IPs in front of locators just for SpringXD.    Ref to the SpringXD docs found in 1.0.3 and 1.1.0GA versions:    “The locator option is mostly intended for integration with an existing GemFire installation in which the cache servers are configured to use locators in accordance with best practice. While GemFire supports configuration of multiple locators for failover, this is currently not supported in XD.

To that effect, the option of using a different partitioned job coordination strategy, that relies on a distributed computing coordination mechanism such as ZooKeeper should be investigated. ",8

XD-2767,"JMS Source Does Not Expose `acknowledge`","Since the message-driven adapter uses a {{DMLC}}, the default behavior is to lose messages on exceptions (with the DMLC, the message is ack'd before the listener is invoked).    In order to provide recovery of such situations, the source needs to expose {{acknowledge}} so it can be set to {{transacted}}.

Methods without timeout parameter are usually blocking and return the first message delivered to the channel (e.g. org.springframework.integration.channel.AbstractPollableChannel#receive()).     Integration tests based on spring-xd-test dependency and embedded xd-singlenode are asynchronous. This makes AbstractSingleNodeNamedChannelSink receive method return null in all invocations because test thread is progressing faster than container can process the message in the background.    Would it be possible to make receive methods behave like in AbstractPollableChannel?",1

XD-2868,"Support Partitioned Batch Jobs with a LocalMessageBus","Initial support for partitioned batch jobs (initially tested with a local bus) had an {{ExecutorChannel}} in the job context to enable multiple partitions to run. Otherwise, with a local bus, only one partition would run at a time.    When further work was done to support other buses, this was removed and the bus was used to control partition concurrency.    The {{LocalMessageBus}} was changed to use an unbounded task executor; this was wrong because now all partitions ran at once.    Further changes to the local bus changed the task executor to be pooled, but with default properties that mean only one thread is used.    Further, the pool configuration is bus-wide so you can't use that configuration to select the concurrency for an individual job.    The bottom line is that the local bus is not suitable for partitioned batch jobs; it was not anticipated that it would be used for this scenario. With 1.0.x too many partitions run (all); with 1.1.x only one thread runs (by default).    In the local bus, we need to use a configurable, dedicated, bounded task executor for each batch job. ",5

XD-2988,"Issues with custom modules when using module configuration","SpringXD seems to think that a module exists if there is a module configuration present. There is also an issue of having to restart the node when theres been a problem with uploading/removing a module.  When using SpringXD in single node on windows, i uploaded a custom module and then added a folder and property file for it in the module configuration directory as specified in the documentation. When i went to delete the module using the command in the SpringXD admin console, it would say that it was successfull, but when then listing the modules, it would still be listed. If i tried to upload a new version of that same module, i would get an error stating that module already existed with the same name. I would check the custom modules directory and my jar would not be there. I would then have to manually delete the module configuration directory and restart SpringXD before being able to upload a new module, having to replace my module configuration each time.  Seems like there are three things wrong here: * should the presence of a module configuration alone inform SpringXD of a modules existence? * should one have to delete a module configuration before uploading a new version of the module? * when getting module deletion/upload errors, should one have to restart spring xd node to get it to allow the upload again?",1

XD-3006,"db.password not being passed when Sqoop job --create called from Spring-XD Batch job","Created a single definition Sqoop Job --create statement. When processed through Sqoop direct (see attach image for props in repos. jobname sqoop2)   Notice: job definition set db.require.password = false and has a propname called db.password that holds the value for password.   When same definition is created as a batch job via Spring-XD (see image jobname lookupd_job), the db.require.password prop is set to ""TRUE"" and the db.password is not even created as a row.  This causes a password prompt when trying to execute the job in Sqoop direct, that was created via a spring-XD batch job.   Note the job definition for Spring-XD job contains meta-connect with username and password defined as well as import jdbc: --connect username and password. When created via Sqoop (no Spring-XD) password is stored and job is able to execute with no prompt.  Please see attachment for repository job values. Highlighted in yellow is the discrepant property and value attribution. Please reach out if there are questions or need further details.

XD-3012," gemfire-json-server multiple PdxTypes Types","I am using SpringXD to ingest tweets to a gemfire-json-server sink.

Incompatible types.  What are the recommended ways to resolve this?  The field type should account for the largest possible value, which is unknown because it is twitter.

For the record the commit (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-xd/commit/2d5f3f706330a6ead8e91c9a7a23d4372715614d) implies that it should work in the more restricted way above, not the less restricted way.

XD-3078,"Spring XD admin fails to redeploy modules after Spring XD container successfully reconnectes to Zookeeper","We are running Spring XD 1.1.1 in our production environment and Zookeeper 3.4.5.  Zookeeper is running in failover mode and consists of three independent nodes set up on three separate VMs. From time to time we get ""Connection to Zookeeper Suspended"" event which causes one of the containers in the cluster to be removed from the SpringXD cluster. Modules being deployed on this removed node fail to be re-deployed to other containers in the cluster.    Affected versions:  - SpringXD 1.1.1  - Zookeeper 3.4.5 and 3.4.6    Cluster set up in PROD environment where error occurs:  - 4 Spring-XD dedicated servers  - 4 spring-xd containers (each running on designated server )  - 2 spring-xd admins ( each running alongside one spring-xd container)  - 3 Zookeeper nodes ( 3 designated servers on PAITO environment )    Cluster set up in TEST environment where error also occurred:  - 2 Spring-XD dedicated servers running one spring-xd container and one spring-xd admin each  - 3 Zookeeper nodes running on 3 dedicated servers (PAITO Test environment)    Cluster set up to reproduce error found in PROD environment:  - 1 spring-xd admin  - 3 spring xd-containers (each running on a designated VM )  - 3 zookeeper servers running on one VM    Steps to reproduce:    1)	Set up three node Zookeeper cluster. Attached is example zoo.cfg, we are using default configuration values. In this particular test case we run all Zookeeper nodes on a single VM as we were not testing network layer interruptions.  2)	Set up one Spring XD admin node. Please note that we have also observed this on two node Spring XD admin cluster.   3)	Set up three Spring XD container nodes. All of them belong to one group (SA) and two of them also belong to second group (HA1). This is configured in $XD_HOME/config/servers.yml however so far group configuration never influenced test outcome.  4)	Create and deploy a test stream using following XD Shell commands:  stream create --name test-zookeeper-failover --definition ""syslog-udp --port=5140 | transform | file --dir='/opt/pivotal/spring-xd/xd/output'""  stream deploy --name test-zookeeper-failover --properties ""module.syslog-udp.criteria=groups.contains('HA1'),module.syslog-udp.count=2,module.file.criteria=groups.contains('SA'),module.file.count=3,module.transform.criteria=groups.contains('SA')""  5)	Ensure that test stream works and handles traffic on UDP port 5140  6)	Shutdown one of the Zookeeper nodes by issuing a stop command.  7)	Two Spring XD containers were not affected and remained in Spring XD cluster.  8)	One Spring XD container was kicked out of Spring XD cluster and was no longer visible on Spring XD admin Web UI. Modules previously deployed to this container were not redeployed to other cluster members.  9)	On the failed Spring XD container we have observed CONNECTION_SUSPEND, CONNECTION_RECONECTED and CHILD_REMOVE Zookeeper events (attached is container-log.txt). Please note that Java process is still running and we see “ConnectionStateManager-0 server.ContainerRegistrar - Waiting for supervisor to clean up prior deployments�? messages.  10)	Spring XD admin failed with exception in DepartingContainerModuleRedeployer (attached is admin-log.txt).   11)	We have observed that departing container node in Zookeeper (/sa/deployments/modules/allocated/1d3fd4cc-5a70-47ed-b4f3-22deef1f4d4f/) had no children. We did this after few minutes so we are not sure at which point it was cleared.   12)	Restarting failed Spring XD container fixed the problem, modules were correctly redeployed.  Exception from point 10 is very similar to XD-1983 and this code was rewritten in XD-2004.  ",8

XD-3100,"module.*.count > 1 duplicates messages on taps","Using module.name.count > 1 when deploying taps causes duplication of messages in those modules. This impacts balancing of the containers and modules in a cluster as messages should not be duplicated across modules if the same module is deployed twice to two containers in order to spread the load.  We use taps quite heavily in our project mainly for analytics of the life feed in real time but due to issue we have discovered and described in this bug we are currently facing a limitation where heavily processing modules can not be load balanced across the cluster as they are causing duplication of the messages and therefore the same module deployed to two  containers would still process the same message twice.  To demonstrate the problem please see test case scenario set up below:  h4. 1. Environment  - Spring-XD version 1.1.1-RELEASE - Running two spring-xd containers and one spring-xd admin  h4. 2. Set up  Stream definition is as follows:   {quote}stream create --name test-module-count --definition ""syslog-udp --port=5140 | transform | log"" stream deploy --name test-module-count --properties ""module.*.count=2"" stream create --name tap-test-module-count --definition ""tap:stream:test-module-count.syslog-udp > transform --expression='payload.toString() + \""TAPPED\""' | log"" stream deploy --name tap-test-module-count --properties ""module.*.count=2""{quote}   Please refer to the screen shots attached to see that after deploying those two streams we have:  - streams successfully deployed ( module-count-spring-xd-streams.png ) - streams successfully deployed with count=2 to both containers ( module-count-spring-xd-containers.png )  - 5 queues created in Rabbit ( module-count-rabbit.png ) where two were created for the syslog-udp collector as a result of using module.syslog-udp.count=2 - this is causing messages to be duplicated. Normally the expectation would be to have only one queue for the tap  h4. 3. Test input data  I have sent a very simple UDP message to the listening udp collector running on second container:   {quote}echo test-module-count >> /dev/udp/host02/5140{quote}  h4. 4.

XD-3145,"Update batch modules to be short lived","h2. Narrative  As a developer, I'd like a job module to be bootstrapped when the job is launched and shut down once it is complete instead of the current behavior of bootstrapping the context when the module is deployed regardless of if it's being used so that I can achieve better resource utilization.    h2. Back story  While streams are never ending, batch jobs have a true lifecycle with a beginning and and end.  By having a job bootstrapped when it's not executing, it eats up precious resources.  For example, if I have a job that creates connections to a database via a connection pool, the job module will hold those connections from the moment it's deployed to the moment it's undeployed, even if the job isn't being executed.  A more efficient use of resources would be to have the job module provide just enough to receive the launch request and then bootstrap the job's context    h2.

XD-3147,"Composing Jobs via the DSL","h2. Narrative  As a developer, I want to be able to construct jobs using a DSL similar to the current syntax for streams.    h2.  Back story  Streams currently provide a DSL for assembling modules into flows (streams) that consist of a source, n processors, and a sink.  While constructing the steps of jobs themselves would be difficult in this manor, creating flows of jobs (essentially a job that consists only of job steps) would be very useful.  It would allow a developer to create something like the following:    {code}  filejdbc | mycustomjob | jdbchdfs  {code}    This approach also allows the existing packaging/module registry/etc to work out of the box.

The second time you run the job, the files are not deleted.    I believe the issue here is that since the {{FileDeletionStepExecutionListener}} is a singleton, the resources are resolved only once (the first time the job runs) and so it works the first time, but if the job is run again later and new files match the expression, they are not picked up.

XD-3296,"Spike: Design a tasks repository","h2. Narrative  As a developer, I'd like to be able to run a boot jar as a task on CF and obtain the result reliably.    h2. Back story  Currently Lattice/Diego's tasks implementation provides the ability to run things as short lived tasks.  However, obtaining the result of said task can be an issue.  There are two ways to do so:    # Poll for the result.  # Register a callback URL to be called once the task completes.    Since a task is only available for a short time after its completion before it is deleted, polling can run the risk of missing the result completely.  When you consider the fact that the provided GUIDs that identify tasks can be re-used polling becomes a precarious option.    Registering a callback URL would be a better option, however there are no good guarantees that the message will be delivered.  The service will try to execute the callback until it's successful or the task is cleaned up.  ""Successful"" is defined in this case as anything other than a 502 or a 503 return code.    In order for Spring XD to be able to support Diego tasks, a more durable option for maintaining the result of tasks will need to be developed.    *Note:* The outcome of this spike may be feature requests for the CF/Diego team.",8

I'm sure you guys have a good reason to add the prefix  but I don't see why. Unfortunately is  annoying when you are developing in a local VM where you can test the  simple authentication and after move the job to dev/prod environments with kerberos auth, the above because you must change your sqooptasklet configuration injecting the new parameters. If the SqoopTasklet allows inject those parameters directly from the hadoop.properties file you don't need change tasklet  configurations to run your jobs with different authentication methods.

XD-3612,"Redis Message Bus still accessed when using direct binding","I have a distributed XD Cluster with one admin and two containers using Redis as the message bus. In certain cases I want to use direct binding to remove communication with the message bus and deploy all modules to all containers with the aim of improving performance. I’ve found that even when using direct binding, XD still communicates with Redis when it shouldn’t need to. This could have an impact on performance.    This is easily reproducible in our 2 container cluster as follows:    Use the redis-cli monitor command to monitor Redis.    Create and deploy a simple stream with direct binding:    {code}  stream create --definition ""http | log"" --name httpLog  stream deploy --name httpLog --properties ""module.*.count=0""  {code}    As expected both modules get deployed to both nodes. Testing shows messages sent to the http endpoint of one container always come out in the log for that container implying direct binding is in play as expected.    However once the streams are deployed the Redis monitor starts showing a Redis queue being accessed from both XD conatiners:    {code}  1444731527.086325 [0 10.0.1.8:57454] ""brpop"" ""queue.httpLog.0"" ""1""  1444731528.086304 [0 10.0.1.4:37337] ""brpop"" ""queue.httpLog.0"" ""1""  1444731529.086341 [0 10.0.1.8:57454] ""brpop"" ""queue.httpLog.0"" ""1""  1444731530.086317 [0 10.0.1.4:37337] ""brpop"" ""queue.httpLog.0"" ""1""  1444731531.086340 [0 10.0.1.8:57454] ""brpop"" ""queue.httpLog.0"" ""1""  1444731532.086505 [0 10.0.1.4:37337] ""brpop"" ""queue.httpLog.0"" ""1""  {code}    This shouldn’t need to happen in direct binding. These messages stop once the stream is undeployed.  ",5
XD-3613,"Multiple module instances consuming from taps or topics get duplicate messages on redis Message Bus","If I deploy more than one instance of a module (eg using module.name.count > 1 or module.name.count =0) that consumes from a tap or topic then I get duplicate messages if I’m using Redis as the message bus. It looks like this is the same issue as XD-3100 but the fix for that only fixed Rabbit as the message bus.    This is easy to reproduce on a 2 container cluster using a Redis Message Bus:    Create and deploy streams as follows:    {code}  stream create --definition ""http | log"" --name httpLog  stream deploy --name httpLog --properties ""module.*.count=0""  stream create --definition ""tap:stream:httpLog > transform --expression='payload.toString() + \"" TAPPED\""' | log"" --name httpLogTap   stream deploy --name httpLogTap --properties ""module.*.count=0""  {code}    On container 1 send a message:    {code}  curl --data ""test message 001"" http://localhost:9000/httpLog  {code}    Container 1 logs are then:    {code}  2015-10-13 14:16:28.853  INFO 22774 --- [ol-28-thread-18] xd.sink.httpLog                          : test message 001  2015-10-13 14:16:28.855  INFO 22774 --- [enerContainer-4] xd.sink.httpLogTap                       : test message 001 TAPPED  {code}    and container 2:    {code}  2015-10-13 14:16:28.859  INFO 22719 --- [enerContainer-4] xd.sink.httpLogTap                       : test message 001 TAPPED  {code}    Ie the tapped message is duplicated (picked up by both tap module instances)    Similarly for topics create and deploy these streams:    {code}  stream create --definition ""http > topic:mytopic"" --name httpTopic  stream deploy --name httpTopic --properties ""module.*.count=0""  stream create --definition ""topic:mytopic > transform --expression='payload.toString() + \"" TOPIC CONSUMER 1\""' | log"" --name topicConsumer1  stream deploy --name topicConsumer1 --properties ""module.*.count=0""  stream create --definition ""topic:mytopic > transform --expression='payload.toString() + \"" TOPIC CONSUMER 2\""' | log"" --name topicConsumer2  stream deploy --name topicConsumer2 --properties ""module.*.count=0""  {code}    On container 1 send a message:    {code}  curl --data ""test message 002"" http://localhost:9000/httpLog  {code}    Container 1 logs are then:    {code}  2015-10-13 14:34:23.168  INFO 22774 --- [enerContainer-2] xd.sink.topicConsumer2                   : test message 002 TOPIC CONSUMER 2  2015-10-13 14:34:23.172  INFO 22774 --- [enerContainer-2] xd.sink.topicConsumer1                   : test message 002 TOPIC CONSUMER 1  {code}    and container 2:    {code}  2015-10-13 14:34:23.173  INFO 22719 --- [enerContainer-2] xd.sink.topicConsumer2                   : test message 002 TOPIC CONSUMER 2  2015-10-13 14:34:23.177  INFO 22719 --- [enerContainer-2] xd.sink.topicConsumer1                   : test message 002 TOPIC CONSUMER 1  {code}    Ie the topic message is picked up by each instance of the module in each stream.

XD-3643,"Allow sending to multiple named channels at once","Currently it’s possible to do this via   {code}  source | router --expression=''queue:queue1,queue:queue2''  {code}  but this involves an additional hop to the message bus for the pipe between the source and router.    It would be better if this was supported directly with the existing named channel syntax to remove this pipe ie  {code}  source > queue:queue1,queue:queue2  {code}  This would be useful as a possible solution in the scenario described in XD-3613 as an alternative to using topics on the Redis message bus which don’t support having multiple instances of the same consumer.

XD-3646,"Composite Multiple Sink Module","This would allow multiple individual sink modules to be combined via the shell DSL so that each message sent to the composite sink module will be sent to each of the individual sink modules in turn.   Internally this would probably use a recipient list router to send to each individual sink.    Module options for each individual sink would be combined to create the overall options for the composite sink module in a similar way to existing composite modules.    This would allow construction of streams with less communication with the message bus for example as an alternative to using a named topic in the message bus.    Using this in conjunction with sinks built using existing composite module functionality (as a combination of processors and a sink) would allow more sophisticated combinations to be constructed and deployed as a single module (with no message bus communication).    One particular application of this would be with tap and counter functionality. If multiple fields in a message need counted this currently needs to be done as separate streams tapping the original with the overhead of the tapped message being read from the message bus multiple times potentially on different nodes, this enhancement would allow all the counters to be combined to make a more cohesive composite counter module so that the tapped message would only need to be read once.

XD-3723,"Improve support for custom headers when using Kafka Message Bus","I understand Kafka natively does not have the concept of message headers. However, Spring Integration messages do and a lot of SI components are built specifically for dealing with message headers (header-enricher, header-filter, header-value-router, etc...). In addition, message headers are very useful for tracking meta-information about messages as they progress through a system.    With the implementation of https://jira.spring.io/browse/XD-3621; Spring XD has limited support for custom headers when using Kafka as a transport. I say limited, because it is required to list all custom headers explicitly in servers.yml in order for the headers to be retained by the MessageBus.    This is less than ideal because it means that it is necessary to know all potential custom header values a user will require before starting the environment.    It would be nice to extend this functionality so that it is not necessary to list custom headers in the configuration. Instead, when operating in mode=embeddedHeaders, Spring XD will simply embeds ALL headers in the Kafka message. Or alternatively, allow for a wildcard in the 'headers' configuration option so that it is not necessary to exhaustively list all possible custom header values prior to starting the system.",5

May be important to note that we had a zookeeper data corruption on which support asked us to upgrade. We couldn't upgrade just yet, so I cleaned up zookeeper and recreated all streams/job from original scripts.     I have observed this behavior after the corruption - I cannot tell for sure if the behavior was there or not before the corruption. In case it is not easily reproducible then it could be environment specific issue.    I may update JIRA once i get time to try it on my local distributed mode.  ",1
